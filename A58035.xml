            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have long waited for an opportunity to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the many and great Obligations I have been under by your Ladiſhip, and your Family, ſince Providence put ſuch a Price into my hand as
<pb facs="tcp:52041:3"/>the mercy of your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and this is one reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others why I Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate theſe poor papers to you &amp; yours.<note place="margin">2 Joh. 1.5.</note> When I conſidered how <hi>John</hi> wrote to the Elect Lady, and her Children walking in the Truth,<note place="margin">One obſervs that <hi>St. John</hi> who was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple avas of a Noble ſtock, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was ſo known of the High Prieſt that he did not fear the Jews, ſo as the other Diſciples did. Where Nobility is enamelled with grace, it renders it far mere illuſtrious and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did.</note> I was much encouraged thereunto. Beſides upon theſe accounts I could not but lay hold of the preſent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 1. The Care that I know you have many years conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſpent in the Education of thoſe tender Branches, the Lord hath honoured you with. O what glory might have been raiſed up to God, if in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Honour and Quality there had been ſuch diligence in train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Poſterities, in the fear of that God, whom it is a great
<pb facs="tcp:52041:3"/>Honour to ſerve! 2. The great ſucceſs that crowned your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips endeavours herein, (that the Lord let you ſee your dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſet upon ſeeking the Lord betimes,) that ſo many morning ſeekers in ſuch a Family (as I muſt confeſs I have not elſewhere known) while the dew of Gods bleſſing upon your Education lay upon theſe Branches; how did they while young grow up in Holy Affections and Deſires after the Wayes and Truths of God! 3. And all this much in a time when the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in many great Families was much diſcouraged (if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry'd) though Goſpel duties, reading the Word, praying in Families, a ſtrict obſervation of Sabbaths did grow in to reproach
<pb facs="tcp:52041:4"/>and contempt in many Houſes: yet all that time the Lord helped you to Reſolve with an Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and holy perſon of Old, <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſh. 24.15.</note>4. The great encouragement that you have given, not only to me the meaneſt of thoſe Servants of God acquainted with your Family, but that you have given to many more in a dark and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my day. O how many Families have you and yours refreſhed in a day of ſtraits I and is it any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to teſtifie this before this uncharitable world? 5. The Lord honouring you with ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of judgment, theſe giddy reeling times; that in dayes and times when erroneous notions and principles, as well as corrupt practices have overſpread many
<pb facs="tcp:52041:4"/>Families, you have been preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth, and have taken great care that your Children ſhould, while they were young, be trained up in the truth, as it is in Jeſus. If I had no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for my preſent tender of theſe poor endeavours to you and yours, are not theſe enough? But I am afraid you will ſay here is more than enough ſaid: though not ſo much as might. I did not know upon ſerious thoughts how ſuch a deſign as this might tend to encourage or promote good beginnings and breathings after God in your Family. And though, through the rich mercy and grace of God, you be not a tender young plant in the Courts of God, but grown up in the Grace and Knowledge of our

               <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yet here may be ſome thing preſented to your children that may prove through a bleſſing from above of uſe to them, as to their further progreſs in the good wayes of God. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred one thing, when I thought of this Dedication, how often<note n="*" place="margin">When I had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with them.</note> ſome of them did employ me to buy or acquaint them with what Books they ſhould buy proper and uſeful for them; and who are fitter to Dedicate an uſeful Book to, than ſuch? (if God will ſo pleaſe to make this poor Treatiſe.) There are Lambs (your Ladiſhips know) in the flock of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that need carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as thoſe that are with young, that need leading; there are Babes in <hi>Chriſts</hi> School who have need of milk, as well as
<pb facs="tcp:52041:5"/>ſtronger Chriſtians that need ſtronger meat. If this may be milk, ſincere milk that any of Gods new born Babes may grow thereby, yea, any of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may grow up in grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, this will be the rejoycing of the Author. Now <hi>Madam,</hi> that God would cauſe your Houſe to grow, who hath made a ſure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with you and yours, and that the dew of Heaven, as well as fatneſs of the Earth may be the portion of you and yours, is the prayer of</p>

            <head>To all Young Ones whoſe hearts are ſet to ſeek the Lord before it be too late, who are and deſire ſtill to be Morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</head>
            <p>WHen I conſidered the dangers that ſuch a day, as we live in, expoſes your precious Souls to, I was willing for your Souls ſakes to contribute my Mite to that Work which ſo many Reverend and Worthy Servants of Christ had gone before me in: Yet we living in a ſleepy Age, and knowing we have ſleepy hearts, we muſt be often calling on; and the more Calls, and the more Cryers, the more are Souls ſtirred and ſtartled. I have ſadly obſerved ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things ſince I with others of the
<pb facs="tcp:52041:7"/>Lords Servants have been under this preſent day and diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That our great hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we have had of the Lords effectual working upon the hearts of Young Ones, have often met with great diſappointments; and many of the poor Miniſters of Chriſt have been like the Troops of <hi>Tema,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 6.19, 20.</note> and the Company of <hi>Sheba,</hi> waiting for ſome good iſſue of the travel of their Souls, but they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, becauſe they had hoped they were aſhamed; and is not this cruelty, to cruſh our hopes and croſs our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who travel for you, and all in hope Chriſt might be formed in you? Will it be your gain if we loſe our prayers, our tears, our ſtudies, our pains? Will this be profitable to you, if all our deſigns for your good be made by your ſelves miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying deſigns?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That it is a great reproach to the wayes of God, and name of God, when ſuch, as have been for a time forward for God, do go back again. How hath the Name of God been blaſphemed many
<pb facs="tcp:52041:7"/>times by the miſcarriages of ſuch? And how may it be ſaid of many Young Ones, as was ſaid of that Fig-tree Jeſus Chriſt curſed,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.20.</note> 
               <hi>How ſoon is this Fig-tree wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered away!</hi> Where is your Zeal, your Affections, your Love, your fervency for God, for his Ordinances, for Duties, for Worſhip, that once ſeemed to move upon your Spirits? O conſider of it young men, that the wayes of God have been evil ſpoken of by your means. And I may ſay to you as the Prophet to them, <hi>This hath been by your means.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The going back of ſuch I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved is a great ſtumbling-block to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a great diſcouragement to others to own the wayes of God. O ſay ſuch poor Souls, ſhall not I prove as others have done? make a fair flouriſh for a year or two, bear green leaves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing buds and bloſſoms, but yet for all that brings forth no fruit to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? And therefore ſuch poor Souls rather ſit ſtill, ſeeing ſo many that have been in a fair way of profeſſion, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide and apoſtatize before them.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52041:8"/>
               <hi>4.</hi> Many poor Sinners have been hardned in their Atheiſm, Profaneneſs and contempt of the wayes of God by ſeeing you fall off after that you have made ſome progreſs in the wayes of God. Do not they conclude at the ſight of ſuch miſcarriages, that their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are good,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note> though they walk in the imaginations of their own heart? Do not they cry Peace, Peace to their own Souls, though they walk in Soul-undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying courſes? Take two young men, One of them falls under ſome conviction of ſin, under the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word, upon this Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he launches out into a viſible Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, owns the wayes of God, Hears, Prays, Reads, repeats Sermons, &amp;c. The other of them continues ſinning on ſtill, ſenſeleſs of his Soul, kicks againſt the pricks ſtill, but he cryes, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion will return to him again, this is but for a fit, a little melancholy, or to pleaſe ſome party or other. Well, in a little time it proves thus, the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing young man becomes profane again, returns with the dog to his vomit,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22.</note> and
<pb facs="tcp:52041:8"/>with the Sow after once waſhing to her wallowing in the mire, returns to his Onions and Garlick again: O how this doth now harden the other poor Sinner in his dangerous and damnable ſtate, and makes him venture his Soul to live and lye, and dye in it!</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> I have obſerved ſuch Young Men that once have taſted ſome thing of the Word of God, and have laid under Convictions of Sin, when they have fallen off and loſt them, they have grown harder after than before; they have like the wicked men we read of, grown worſe and worſe:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.13.</note> Such have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped others in ſin. As Iron often heated proves harder, ſo it is with ſuch poor Souls; and is not this a ſad ſight to ſee him a Drunkard, a Swearer, a Reviler, a Scoffer at the wayes of God, who once was a praying Young Man? One that worſhipt with thoſe he now ſcoffs at and reviles? If one had told thee while thou wert a praying, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Young Man, that thy Praying, thy Hearing, thy repeating Sermons, would have ended thus, would not
<pb facs="tcp:52041:9"/>thou have ſaid as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to the Prophet,<note place="margin">2 Kings 8.13.</note> 
               <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog?</hi> O but have not a few years produced too many ſuch inſtances?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> I have obſerved, that as ſoon as many Young Ones have ſet forth under Convictions of a need of Chriſt to ſeek after him, they many times have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into erroneous notions. When Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cannot keep poor Souls in profane practices, he then will labour to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon them with pernicious Principles. And as the Devil hath his Nurſeries to debauch Young Ones in their Practices, ſo he hath his Nurſeries to poyſon them with pernicious Principles. No ſooner doth a Young Man become ſober and ſerious, but there are perſons that are ready to drop their poyſon upon them; and ſo many poor Souls are ſet wrong at the very firſt ſetting out.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> I have obſerved Young Ones to be <hi>like fooliſh Children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.13.</note> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayes, <hi>to ſtay long in the place of breaking forth;</hi> Eſpecially Young Ones under Godly Education, nurſed
<pb facs="tcp:52041:9"/>up in Godly Families: How long is it often before the work be a through-work upon their Spirits? Alas, how do their Convictions come and go, for months, if not for years ſome times, not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; and then another while Conſcience being a <hi>Boanarges</hi> to them, thundring forth the terrours of the Lord to them. One while they are murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, another while they walk and make a dreadful noiſe in the Conſcience. Here poor Soul, thou may ſee thy danger in delaying thy great work of ſeeking in thy prime and flower of thy youth.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8.</hi> I have obſerved a great deal of pride grow up with the Profeſſion of Young Ones. O how often hath this been the mortal bane and poyſon of many of their Souls! How many have upon this Rock ſplit their Convictions, their Profeſſion, their Expectations with their Souls for ever? Have not many poor Young Seekers been over-ſet by carrying too much ſail? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon their ſuppoſition of acquired gifts and parts how have they prided themſelves? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till as the Poets ſay of young <hi>Narciſſus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52041:10"/>that he fell in love with his own ſhadow untill he pined away. Have not many Young Seekers fallen into a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by ſelf-love, and ſetting too high a price upon themſelves? Nay, hath not this ſin cauſed the Lord to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome of them to fall into ſome viſible groſs evil, that might keep them little and low in their own eyes all their dayes? Many have got a halt at the first ſetting out, that they might be kept from ſelf-exaltation.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9.</hi> I have obſerved an untractable Spirit grow up with Young Ones, to their Superiours and Guides, which is a dangerous evil. Doth this become young Travellers, nay indeed any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers to caſt off their Guides? or to think they can get to their journeys end, without obſerving the Counſels, Conduct, and the directions of ſuch as are ſet over them in the Lord? Are Miniſters ſet over you to be your Guides, are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, are Maſters ſet over you to be your Guides,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> and will you prove untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable to theſe? This is a great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Lord, which occaſioned
<pb facs="tcp:52041:10"/>that Exhortation of <hi>Peter</hi>'s, <hi>You younger ſubmit your ſelves to the elder.</hi> As it particularly relates to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſo it may refer to others. At what door came in Erroneous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> at firſt, and Licentious Practices? Was it not at this, when perſons refuſed to obey and ſubmit to them that were ſet over them in the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>10.</hi> I have obſerved that Satans grand Deſigns and Engines are laid ſo as (if it be poſſible) to prevent Jeſus Chriſt having a Young Off-ſpring. The Devil would not have Chriſt have any Nurſeries, any Young Nurſeries, where any tender Plants ſhould be ſet and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that they might become Trees of Righteouſneſs. Therefore he hath his Nurſeries to debauch and corrupt them; like <hi>Herod,</hi> he is all for killing Chriſt in the cradle. O this puts him upon that rage and wrath in purſuing poor Souls, as ſoon as their Convictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtir in them. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſaw them attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſcape; ſo doth Satan follow poor Young Ones as ſoon as ever they look
<pb facs="tcp:52041:11"/>out of their miſerable Captivity under which they are in their natural eſtates and conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11.</hi> I have obſerved that the Lords effectual working upon the hearts of Young Ones, is, and hath been a token of ſome approaching appearance of God on the behalf of a People or a Nation. It argues God hath ſtill ſome work there, ſome thing to do there, that he would not leave that place and people. He doth not beget Children for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, he doth not uſe to beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſend away the breaſts from them. And on the contrary when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion-work ceaſes, O then ſome heavy blow comes! Some National ſtroak is at the door! When the Harveſt is inn'd, then the labourers are called home, and this portends a ſtorm. Ambaſſadours calling home looks like a War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12.</hi> I have obſerved the ſad and doleful heart-breaking lamentations of many Godly Parents over the Souls of their dear and dead Children, many Families mourning over their dead.
<pb facs="tcp:52041:11"/>There was a great cry throughout the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> when the Firſt-born was dead.<note place="margin">Exod. 11.6.</note> O what a cry hath gone through the Land for the Souls of poor dead Children! One Family crying, Lord, this dear Child is dead, his Soul is dead while he lives;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.5.</note> (as is ſaid of ſome, while they live in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are dead) and that which cuts poor Parents to the heart, is this, they fear they ſhall ere long hear ſuch a cry for their Childrens Souls, as was in the night time in the great Plague ſome times, <hi>Caſt out your dead, caſt out your dead.</hi> O then ſayes one Family, LORD, how many have we to caſt out? So many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo few of them made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to God, ſo few that have Chriſt formed in their precious Souls? O you Young Ones that are the Seed of Godly Parents, if you miſcarry to all Eternity, your Parents Tears and Frayers, I muſt tell you, will be as ſo much oyl to make Hell flames burn ſo much the more vehemently upon you. If you that are Children of the
<pb facs="tcp:52041:12"/>Kingdome by Education, be ſhut out, this will aggravate your condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dreadfully.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>13.</hi> I have obſerved that the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of ſuch Young Ones, in the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of Sin, as have ſprung from, and have been nurſed up in Godly Families, have rolled much reproach upon Gods Covenant. If the reproach was only upon their Perſons, it would not be ſo laid to heart; though for a Son to be an occaſion of reproach to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Family is ſad: but that which goes deeper is, the Covenant of God is reproached. The world ſay, they ſee no difference betwixt the poſterity of the Godly and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, and this is an over-whelming conſideration to them. And O Young Ones, is neither the Name of God, nor the Name of your tender Parents, nor your Families, nor your immortal Souls precious in your eyes? How may that Endictment be drawn up againſt you?<note place="margin">Mic. 7.6.</note>

            <p>The Words are the Promiſe of Chriſt, to young Seekers, by way of encouragement, to continue, and hold on in ſeeking him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have the Perſons to whom

            <p n="2">2. We have the Perſon that makes this Promiſe, <hi>They that ſeek me</hi> (viz.) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is apparent all over the Chapter, that is meant of Chriſt, who is here called Wiſdom, who indeed is the Wiſdom of the Father. I need not take up time in proving this, the very Text carries its own Evidence in it. O Poor Soul! Chriſt himſelf is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52041:14"/>your Encourager, what ever Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements you meet withall, and this he doth by his own Promiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

They ſhall not ſeek, as God threatned them, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>they ſhall ſeek me, with their Herds, and their Flocks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſea 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>and ſhall not find me.</hi> They ſhall not ſeek, and be diſappointed, they ſhall not ſeek and go without, but they ſhall find me; who ever miſs of Chriſt, of all the Perſons in the World, they ſhall not miſs of him. O what Encouragement is here to young Seekers of Chriſt! [This word in the Text we have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thus; (Job 8.5.) <hi>If thou would ſeek God betimes, if thou wouldest morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God:</hi> Shahar <hi>(diluculare Deum diligenter, ſedulò &amp; magno ſtudio quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſervations are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That young Inquirers after Chriſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52041:15"/>are much upon his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Morning Seekers ſhall be ſure, and certain Finders.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That uſually in Souls morning lookers after Chriſt, they meet with much diſcouragement. This is ſtrongly implied, becauſe Chriſt gives them this Promiſe, by way of Encouragement.</hi> We will begin with this laſt.</p>
            <p>Let us enquire a little what theſe Diſcouragements are; what are great Hindrances of poor morning Seekers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From within, there are diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. 2. From without.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Diſcouragements from within. 1. Strong Corruptions; for as ſoon as ever the Soul begins to look out, and enquire after Jeſus Chriſt, then doth Corruption begin to work more ſtrongly, than it did before. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

O poor diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52041:16"/>ſoul! thou ſhalt have ſuch a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over thy Corruptions, as thou wilt for ever ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> in Heaven for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſcouragement from within is weakneſs of Grace. O! ſays the poor ſoul, can ſuch a weak Creature as I ever be able to ſeek Chriſt, through ſo many difficulties? every ſin is too hard for me, every duty too hard for me, I may as well give over praying, and hearing, and contending againſt my ſin, for I find my ſelf ſo weak, I am ever and anon foyled. O poor ſoul! doſt not thou know the Promiſe is made to truth of Grace, and not only to the ſtrength of grace: bruiſed Reeds are within the Promiſe, as well as ſtrong Cedars; the Lambs are under the Promiſe of his Boſome; the weak of the flock this good Shepherd hath promiſed to ſtrengthen; the days of ſmall things he will not deſpiſe; weak ones are neither caſt out, nor caſt off, becauſe of weakneſs, if they be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Diſcouragement is ſenſe of their own vileneſs and unworthineſs. O
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52041:16"/>poor young ones! at firſt ſetting out after Chriſt they are under their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations for Sin, a great piece of which Humiliation lies in the ſenſe of their own Unworthineſs; thus it was with the poor Prodigal, at his firſt coming home to his Father's Houſe; <hi>Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 15.19.</note> 
               <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy Son;</hi> and as the <hi>Samaritan, I am not worthy thou ſhould come under my Roof:</hi> O ſays ſuch a poor ſoul, Lord wilt thou be found of ſuch a wrech as I; ſuch a vile wrech as I?</p>
            <p>O poor ſoul! doſt thou not know that all ſinners that come unto him, though vile, though wretched, though miſerable, are to be welcomed by him? And this as he is commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Father;<note place="margin">John 6.37, 38.</note> 
               <hi>He will in no wiſe caſt out them that come unto him;</hi> and the ſtrength and ſtreſs of all lies here, this is the will of my Father. Now Chriſt will be ſure to act obediential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and faithfully to his Commiſſion received of his Father.<note place="margin">Luke 14.21.</note> Poor Souls! were not the poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were Chriſt's Gueſts, vile, Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinners? High-way ſinners? the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52041:17"/>blind, and maimed? yet how doth Chriſt welcome ſuch Gueſts to his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Are you viler than theſe? Alas poor ſouls! you that are under the ſenſe of your own vileneſs, you come right to Chriſt unworthy of a Pardon, of a good look, of a good word; as they came with Ropes about their necks to the King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accepts and pardons ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Diſcouragement from within is ſenſe of former loſt, and buried Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. While we are under Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or we are under Afflictions, O how ordinary is this! and we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with theſe Convictions. But one Temptation or other, either within, or without, meets thee, and the Conviction preſently is buried; the Soul hears no more of it, it may be for a year, or two; but if the Lord have a gracious deſign upon thee, he cauſes thy Convictions to riſe again, and walk again; and O then the ſoul is troubled, and diſcouraged: Alas! this Conviction is come again, but will it not die, as the laſt did? It will not ſtay long.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52041:17"/>
            <p>O poor Soul! yet this hath uſually been the way of God to cauſe the ſecond Convictions, or the Return of convictions to do their work through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: O how many ſouls have found it ſo! Though truly it is a wonder of mercies, when firſt Convictions are ſmothered and extinguiſhed, that God ever blows them up, and kindles them again.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.7.</note> God often doth with young Seekers, as he did with young <hi>Samuel,</hi> calls him again, and again, though we lie down, and ſleep again, and again; it is ſaid, he knew not the word of the Lord, for he was young.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Diſcouragement is, fears of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeverance, that young ones meet with from within. O ſay theſe poor ſouls, what will become of us poor low Shrubs, when we ſee ſuch tall and ſtrong Cedars fall? Shall we ever be able to hold on in our way? Shall we run and not be weary, walk, and not faint? We ſhall never be able to continue to the far end, to run the Race with patience that is ſet before us.</p>
            <p>O poor Soul! thy Perſeverance in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52041:18"/>the ways of God is Jeſus Chriſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Purchaſe, and Charge. 1. He hath promiſed it,<note place="margin">Iſaiah 40.31.</note> they that wait on the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, even ſo as they ſhall run and not be weary; nay if they cannot, he hath promiſed to carry them;<note place="margin">Iſaiah 40.11.</note> he carries the Lambs in his Boſom, and can any pull them out of his Boſom? If none can pull them out of his hand, much leſs can any pull them out of his heart. 2. Perſeverance is Chriſt's Purchaſe; did he die for you, and will he loſe you? Will he pay the Price, and let another carry away the Purchaſe? Did not he die for Glory, as well as Grace? and Happineſs as well as Holineſs? No, no, not a ſoul that his blood is gone for, can be a miſcarrying ſoul. 3. Your Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is Chriſt's charge, he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for it to his Father:<note place="margin">John 6.37.</note> none that thou haſt given me ſhall be loſt, but I will raiſe it up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have Diſcouragement from without as well as from within, and both meeting together is a great damp to the young Seeker. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52041:18"/>from without are from theſe Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Satan; As ſoon as he ſees they look Chriſt-ward, and Heaven-ward, he begins then to torment them; though while they were his Bondſlaves, they were all the time quiet. As when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to go out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, then <hi>Pharoah</hi> with all his Hoſt purſues them; ſo when a ſoul is going out of his ſpiritual houſe of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Satan with all his might and main labours to reduce them. It is the obſervation of one upon the Church, the Woman in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that all the while ſhe was breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Dragon did not meddle with her; but when ſhe comes to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, then he caſts a flood after the woman to deſtroy both her and her man-child. So all the while a poor ſoul is under ſome Breathings and deſires only after Chriſt, Satan doth not much tempt, or diſturb it: but when it comes to bring forth Chriſt, and anſwer his Convictions, with a change of Converſation, O then he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52041:19"/>caſts a whole flood of Temptations and diſcouragements after it. And, alas! this proceeds from his envy to the good of your ſouls. He is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious one, and his envy puts him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laying diſcouragements before you: O who can ſtand before Envy? O poor ſoul! the Lord will look after thee, while thou art looking after him. Poor ſoul! be of good cheer, thy Temptations argue his Rage, and his Rage being great argues his time of rule in thy ſoul is like to be ſhort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſcouragement without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Perſecution that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Profeſſion of the Goſpel. While the Sun did ſhine upon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it had many friends: but when it is brought under the Clouds of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, many go away from Chriſt; as he ſaid unto them, Will you alſo go away? There was I remember a Law, that the firſt year of marriage, none ſhould go to War: O but may young ones ſay, what a diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to us, as ſoon as ever we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be married to Chriſt in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, we muſt be Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52041:19"/>and muſt go to War with Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. Well, poor Souls! be not diſcouraged; you ſhall not go to war on your own coſt; The Lord the great Captain of your Salvation will renew your ſtrength, and you ſhall run and not be weary, walk and not faint; though Perſecutions meet you in the way, Jeſus Chriſt hath his ſtrict Charge, and he will look after them in a ſuffering day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Diſcouragement from without is the Oppoſition they meet with from carnal Relations, ſuch as are Encmies to the Croſs of Chriſt. Many times ſuch do mightily oppoſe theſe ways they are ignorant of, which is a great diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>And Satan many times helps on the rage of ſuch, and ſtirs up their wrath; but yet for all this, poor ſoul, be not diſcouraged, when thy way pleaſes the Lord he can make thine Enemies at Peace with thee, much more thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. God many times has turned the heart of Relations about, as he did <hi>Eſau</hi>'s heart to his Brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> when purſuing of him; but if not,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52041:20"/>there is a Friend nearer than a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he will be a friend in the day of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Nay often it is obſerved, that as cold water makes fire burn ſo much the hotter; ſo Grace gains by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by the cold water of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement burns ſo much the brighter. Thy oppoſition will drive thee more to look up to him, where thy ſtrength lies, and ſo may be a great preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Diſcouragement from without is from the miſcarriages of ſuch as do profeſs the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Many that call upon the name of Chriſt, do not depart from iniquity, but walk looſely, deal unrighteouſly betwixt man and man, diſhonour their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by an unſuitable Converſation. Others, they have more groſly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliden from God; and whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they have been praying men in their Families, hearing men, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means of Grace, ſomewhat ſtrict in their lives; now they have thrown off all theſe, and become like other men, as vain as other men, nay
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52041:20"/>as prophane as other men, and this is a great diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>O poor Soul! notwithſtanding this Diſcouragement, yet go on; for the ways of the Lord are the ſame, and if thou follow on to know the Lord, thou wilt find ſweetneſs in his Ordinances and Truth notwithſtanding this.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>Is it ſo that young Seekers, early Seekers meet with Diſcouragement? Word of Uſe is Caution. O let young ones take heed in their firſt looking out after Chriſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of conſulting with fleſh &amp; blood; this will occaſion you to yield to Diſcouragements. It is ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.16.</note> he conſulted not with fleſh and blood. The worſt counſel in the World will fleſh and blood give in the caſe of a mans ſoul. Alas poor young man! will fleſh and blood ſay, what art thou going to do? Art thou able to deny thy ſelf of the delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Youth? Art thou able to cut off a right hand, to put out a right
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52041:21"/>eye, to cut the throat of a beloved <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to let out the hearts blood of a conſtitutional Luſt? Can thy tender years indure ſuch hard things, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is like to be attended with? Canſt thou bear the ſcoffs and jeers of the World, the oppoſitions and diſpleaſure of thy deareſt Relations? And thus will fleſh and blood follow thee: But alas! what is this to a poor ſoul that ſees its precious ſoul lie at ſtake, and is in danger? Cannot, will not this ſoul reply to all theſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of fleſh and blood, Get you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan? What are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverities in the World to a man that ſees and feels he is a loſt ſoul for ever, if he have not a Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed in your firſt ſeekings out, and meeting with diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that you pore not unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly upon your diſcouragements. It is true, there ought to be ſitting down, and counting the coſt, for the want of which many poor ſouls after Profeſſion have backſliden; but the poor young ones may pore too much upon their diſcouragements, may look
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52041:21"/>too much to the dark ſide of the Cloud, and ſay as the Prophet's man did; Alas Maſter, what ſhall we do?<note place="margin">2 Kings 6.15.</note> And the Propher prayed and his eyes were opened, and then he ſaw the Mountains full of Horſemen and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and now he crys out, More are they that are with us, than they that are againſt us. O thus it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young ones! they cry, Alas what ſhall we do? And are utterly diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged until God come and open their eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed you young Seekers under your diſcouragements of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving diabolical ſuggeſtions, that ſhall be caſt into your hearts againſt the ways of God: O! Satan will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuggeſting one thing or other into your hearts; that Chriſt is a hard Maſter, that his Commandments are grievous, that the burdens of the command of the Croſs are intolerable, and that in the way to <hi>Chriſt</hi> are Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Hills inacceſſible, too high for ſuch ſhort breathed Creatures to aſcend or travel over: And O how many poor ſouls by ſuch ſuggeſtions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52041:22"/>have been exceedingly diſcouraged in their purſuits after Chriſt! O but this is dangerous to take counſel of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: would any of you do ſo in other Caſes?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Caution to young Seekers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſcouragements, Take heed of giving over ſeeking, becauſe you find not at firſt what you ſeek: This poor ſouls are very prone to. Why ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer? (ſaid that King.) O ſo ſay many poor ſouls, why ſhould we ſeek Chriſt any longer? Pray any longer? Hear any longer? <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſes in this caſe, dig for Wiſdom as for hidden treaſure, and ſeek her as ſilver. They that dig in ſuch Mines as Gold and Silver, do not give over, becauſe they find not it firſt: O no! it lies deep, and they muſt ſearch with great pains and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. The poor woman ſought her loſt Groat till ſhe found it: O conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſeeking to the far end, till you find: O it is very dangerous to give over, you ſee the Promiſe is, <hi>you ſhall find.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Caution to young Seekers: O
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52041:22"/>take heed when you are under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, you do not murmure againſt God in your Hearts, and ſay as thoſe poor <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, <hi>would to God we had never come out of Egypt;</hi> what was the matter? They meer now with great difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and their hearts fell a murmuring, which in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called a going back in their Hearts: O this doth much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God; as if he could not in his own everlaſting arms, carry poor ſouls over all their difficulties.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Caution, Let young Seekers take heed of drawing up haſty concluſions againſt themſelves, becauſe of preſent diſcouragements; which they are very prone to do.</p>
               <p>O how many poor ſouls raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, for their part, they are cut off, and their hope is loſt; as <hi>David:</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Direction,</hi> Under your diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements be often looking up to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1.11.</note> as the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the whole Work <hi>(viz.)</hi> as the Author of it, and finiſher of it. Did you ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Glorious Name and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I am the <hi>Alpha</hi> and the <hi>Omega;</hi> what is the meaning of this? it notes out the Deity and Eternity of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> (ſo the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52041:23"/>moſt Interpreters) but there ſeems to be ſomething more in it, it notes alſo the Stability and Omnipotency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to execute threatnings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form promiſes,<note place="margin">Iſa. 41.4.44.6.</note> as you may ſee in the places quoted in the Margin, That <hi>Christ</hi> who hath begun a good work, is the <hi>Omega</hi> of it, he will finiſh it. Now do you look up to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to this very end, under this very notion and title; Lord Jeſus the work is thine; the hands of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> (as was ſaid in that day) hath laid the foundation, and the hands of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> muſt finiſh the building; Lord, the <hi>foundation ſtone, Grace,</hi> was of thy laying, and ſo muſt the <hi>Top-ſtone</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> alſo: Do you thus ſay to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when you look up to him? We have the direction expreſly given us by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> Look up to Jeſus as the author and finiſher of our Faith. <hi>Beza</hi> reads, the Captain of our faith and looking. The word ſignifies, ſuch a looking, as calls off the eye from all other objects that repreſent the difficulty of the race; and ſhould not young Souldiers look to their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? In the greateſt diſcouragements
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52041:24"/>that we can be under, we muſt look to him; therefore God ſayes, he hath given him for a Leader and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to the people.<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.4.</note> He is called the Captain of our Salvation, alluding to <hi>Joſhua</hi> the great Captain of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> under whoſe Conduct the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> marcht to the Good Land. Well then poor Soul, do you look to him for finiſhing the whole work: This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo confident of the poor <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Phil. 6.</note> being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it until the day of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Direction</hi> to young Seekers, under all their diſcouragements, is this, Be ſure a good foundation be laid: if there be not a good foundation, your diſcouragements will ſink you, or elſe ſpoyle all your convictions. You know they which built upon the ſand, when diſcouragements beat in upon them, then the houſe fell; but it was not ſo with the houſe upon the Rock;<note place="margin">Luk. 6.48.</note> why, what was the matter? the houſe that fell, digged not deep enough to lay the foundation; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52041:24"/>we read of the Seed that withered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had not depth of earth:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.6.</note> O but now a good foundation laid will bear you up under all your diſcouragments. And what is the reaſon of the Apoſtaſie of young ones, who once have been warm in the wayes of God; alas, the foundation at firſt was not well laid.</p>
               <p>If it be asked what I mean by young ones laying a good foundation, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, there is a two-fold foundation in this ſenſe, Firſt, there is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to ſtate, as to the ſtate of an immortal ſoul, and thus <hi>Christ</hi> is the foundation; there is no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the hopes of eternal ſalvation to be bottomed and built upon; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other foundation can no man lay (ſays the Apoſtle) and therefore the Rock the wiſe builders built upon was <hi>Chriſt:</hi> O then be ſure to let young ones get an intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be built upon him, be bottomed upon him, and then they will weather all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements comfortably.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a foundation as to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Doctrinals, after which young ones ſhould look in their firſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52041:25"/>ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> therefore we read of being built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf being the chief Corner Stone; this foundation was the Principles, and the Doctrine of the Apoſtle; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of the twelve names of the Apoſtles of the Lamb, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the twelve foundations of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> and alas, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do ſouls miſcarry for want of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Principles? I never knew an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled Profeſſor, but at one turn or other he would deſert the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. You young ones may have ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring deſires, ſome ſtirring affection and convictions, but alas many times you neglect Principles. When you meet with a diſcouragement, you will fall back, if you be not laid in with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Do not fiſh begin to ſtink firſt in the head? If the Leproſie was in the head, the High Prieſt was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him utterly unclean. When Satan cannot keep youth in profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then he will labour to poyſon them with Erroneous Principles.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52041:25"/>3. <hi>Direction,</hi> to young inquirers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is this, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your ſelves with the promiſes of the Goſpel, and the way of Faith. Moſtly young ones over-look believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they follow humbling work ſo faſt; it is a piece of admirable skill to put them both together, humbling work, and believing work. O but hard work is this to be humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of ſin, and believe for the pardon of it, at the ſame time. Uſually young Converts ſorrow is too legal; they are the ſweeteſt tears for ſin that flow from faith's eyes; they ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn. Young Seekers are all for mourning, and little ſtudy the way of believing; but go to the Promiſe, and acquaint thy ſelf with the fulneſs, and freeneſs, and ſutableneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of the Promiſes; theſe would be great helps to you in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after <hi>Christ.</hi> Let young ones ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with two or three things in Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Goſpel Promiſes run to weak Grace. They are prone to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52041:26"/>whether the Promiſe belong to them or no; why ſo? O they are ſuch weak Creatures, have ſo little ſtrength againſt ſin, ſo little power againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: O but can thou ſay, Lord, here is truth of Grace, and Lord, I walk before thee with a true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart? O poor Soul, I tell thee the Promiſes run to uprightneſs in heart and truth in the inward parts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let Young Ones acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this, that Goſpel Promiſes look over all unworthineſs in their objects. If thou be the object of Gods love, Promiſes overlook all thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, how is his love free elſe? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee the Promiſes running down to the vileſt of ſinners. O how doth this temptation of unworthineſs ſtand in the way of many a Soul to Chriſt? and hath kept many a Soul and Chriſt a long time at diſtance? but we may ſee this anſwered in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them know that the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of Promiſes doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon any thing in the Creature, but in God himſelf; this hath been a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52041:26"/>great temptation, to look for ſome qualifications in themſelves, and ſo they have been ſpinning ſome webb out of their own bowels; but alas, this can never be a garment to them! God accompliſhes his Promiſes for his own Names ſake.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let Young Seekers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> under their diſcouragements, know, that all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus (viz.)</hi> they all receive in him a full ratification and accompliſhment; ſo that he is undertaker to ſee them all have their performance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let Young Ones, under their diſcouragements, know, that Goſpel Promiſes will carry the Soul through all difficulties they can meet with in their way; there is that in a Promiſe, that will hold up the head, when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſink in the very ſwellings of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> this made <hi>Jacob</hi> plead ſo hard with God, in his difficulty, that old Promiſe, Lord, did not thou ſay, thou wouldſt do me good: therefore when <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſuch hard ſervice to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the conqueſt of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he gave him that Promiſe, <hi>I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52041:27"/>will never leave thee,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> when to leave his Country, <hi>I am God all-ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Direction</hi> to Young Seekers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their diſcouragements; ſtudy well the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is very hard with young ones, to get out of ſelf: O how many years are poor Souls before they get off the bottom of their own Righteouſneſs? they are prone to ſeek ſome things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, who ſought to obtain Righteouſneſs in a way of works, but could not; every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every objection is too hard for a poor Soul, until it get acquaintance with the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but now when a Soul can call the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, by that Name, <hi>The Lord my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 23.6.</note> in this Name every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every objection, every doubt is anſwered in the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> His Righteouſneſs is oppoſed to our guilt: If it be thy nakedneſs that is thy objection, it is anſwered in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, for it is the beſt robe; if it be thy deformity, here it is anſwered, <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſneſs is a

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Direction</hi> to young Seekers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their diſcouragements; pore not upon thy diſcouragements too much. O how ordinary is this! This is to look upon the black and dark ſide of the cloud; what, is there not a bright ſide? Many poor Souls by doing thus, have entred into great temptations; you lead your ſelves into temptations by this means; but this hath been cautioned againſt in the former uſe, therefore I ſhall not enlarge upon it here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſervation</hi> from this Text, we obſerved, was this, <hi>That Young Seekers,</hi> or <hi>Morning Seekers are much upon the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52041:28"/>heart of Chriſt.</hi> It is evident in the Text, it being a Promiſe, by way of encouragement to ſuch poor Souls; O they are ſo much on his heart, he would not have them diſcouraged: O he knows they are ſoon diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; therefore they are upon his heart to encourage them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth encourage them by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of their weak beginnings; when a Scholar is a young beginner, he is ſoon diſcouraged, but when he ſees his Maſter takes notice, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in good part what he doth, this doth much encourage him; and ſo a young Apprentice: Thus it is with a poor Soul at its firſt enquiring after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> when it ſees the Lord accepts and takes in good part its weak moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after Chriſt, its weak affections, and deſires, O it is encouraged; will the Lord accept of any thing ſuch a poor Creature doth? have I any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that can find favour in his ſight? what, ſuch a poor Soul, that am but of yeſterday, that am but newly begun to peep out of my profaneneſs? who have but newly turned my back on the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52041:29"/>ſinful vanities of youth? This was typed out in Gods acceptance of the firſt fruits, though never ſo ſmall; we read the ſheaf of their firſt fruits of their harveſt was to be given to the Prieſt,<note place="margin">Lev. 23.11, 13.</note> and he was to wave it before the Lord, that it might be accepted. If it be but a poor ſheaf, it is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though thou carried out precious Seed weeping; and it may be haſt not gotten thy ſheaves to return with, yet peradventure thou haſt gotten one ſheaf;<note place="margin">Lev. 2.14.</note> Well, carry that to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thy High Prieſt, to wave before the Lord, it may be accepted for you: Yea, if it be but a handful of green ears you bring to the Lord, a few green de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and affections, they ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with the Lord. We read of a glorious work begun in the day of <hi>Zachary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 4.10.</note> in the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and great diſcouragements the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of that Glorious Work met withall; there was a mountain in the way, but all is encouraged by this, <hi>The hands of</hi> Zerubbabel (ſaith God) <hi>hath laid the foundation, and the hands of</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>ſhall finiſh the building.</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52041:29"/>For who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things? ſaith the Lord; there were ſome poor beginnings, and God would not diſcourage them. So I ſay in this caſe, who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things? what though convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be but ſmall, affections ſmall, grace ſmall? yet God accepts of this day of ſmall things, and thus encourages them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth encourage young Seekers, by perſwading their hearts that they ſhall find favour and grace in the ſight of God ſooner or later. Did he ever ſay to the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeek ye my face in vain? O no ſayes the poor Soul, I am under a Promiſe, <hi>they that ſeek ſhall find,</hi> therefore the poor Soul is of good courage. O though a perſon doth meet with diſcouragements, yet ſayes the Soul, I ſhall find, though I digg long firſt, cry long firſt, ſeek long firſt, yet the good hope to ſpeed at laſt becomes a great encouragement: and the contrary is as great a diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Why ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer, pray any longer, hear any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52041:30"/>longer, ſeek any longer? this weakens and enfeebles the Soul exceedingly. What kept up <hi>Jacob</hi> in wreſtling all night, but a ſecret hope, and ſweet perſwaſion that he ſhould for all the oppoſition he met withall, come off conquerour, and at laſt get the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? How is it with your ſouls, young ones, as to this thing? are you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded your praying, ſeeking, will not be in vain? O this is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage young Seekers after him, by making the yoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> eaſier to them every day than other. Every yoke or burden is hardeſt at firſt. O! poor Souls are ready to ſay of the yoke of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> at firſt, as they did of the yoke of Circumſion; wherefore put you upon us a yoke, that neither we nor our Fathers are able to bear? O but this yoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made more eaſie to the ſoul every day than other. Now an Apprentice, or a Scholar, when he finds his work caſier and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to him, O then how is he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to go on it? O now (ſaith the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52041:30"/>ſoul) I find that Scripture true, <hi>Chriſts yoke is an eaſie yoke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and his burden is a light burden;</hi> and that word I now find to be true, and none of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are grievous. Now it may here be demanded, How doth <hi>Christ</hi> make his yoke to young Seekers eaſier every day than other?</p>
               <p n="1">1. By an increaſe of love in them to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As love grows up in the Soul, difficulties are not dreadful; the dread of them is taken off; when the ſpark is blown into a vehement flame, what difficulty can ſtand before it? Who can ſtand before envy? But here it may be ſaid, who can ſtand before love? Many waters cannot quench it. Is not love the greateſt conquerour in the world? How evident is this in mens love to their luſts! O what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate adventures do poor Sinners make to get to their luſts! As <hi>David</hi>'s worthies did break through an Hoſt for the water of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſo do thouſands of Sinners, for love to their ſins, break through a whole Hoſt of Convictions, Reproofs, Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Counſels, and all for love to their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52041:31"/>ſins. And ſo love to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as it increaſes, the commands of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are pleaſant; the wayes of wiſdome are wayes of pleaſantneſs; we take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſerve ſuch as we love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes his yoke eaſier eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day than other, and ſo encourages young Seekers, by making Duty a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. So long as Duty is a burden, there will be grievouſneſs in it, but when it once is matter of delight and priviledge, O then it grows eaſie. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light makes every thing eaſie, though difficult in it ſelf. Alas, a poor Soul at firſt, looks upon the yoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a task, as Scholars have their tasks at firſt; but after delight in them, Prayer now becomes a delight, and the Soul can ſay as the Spouſe did, <hi>I ſit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſhadow with great delight.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God is a great delight; reading and hearing is a great delight; and now theſe duties go ſweetly and eaſily on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He makes his yoke an eaſie yoke, by giving them to ſee a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this yoke, and the yoke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. And now ſayes the poor Soul, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52041:31"/>yoke of Satan would have preſt me down to Hell, I ſhould have drawn my ſelf damned in the Devils yoke, and O now how heavy do I feel it! My ſins are gone over my head as a burden, yea, as too heavy a burden for me to bear. O now when a poor ſinner compares yokes and burdens, O how eaſie doth <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s yoke become!</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage young Seekers, by giving them hearts to wait upon him, and ſweetly and ſecretly renewing their ſtrength in waiting on him. While there is a waiting Spirit, there is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; this was the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Soul, a wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling frame was kept up in him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Soul continues a waiter and wreſtler, there is hope it will come off conquerour; therefore we read of that bleſſed Promiſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>The youths ſhall faint, and the young men ſhall utterly fall, but they that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength;</hi> ſtrength comes in upon your waiting. You young waiters, he will not let you wait upon him for nothing, if your
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52041:32"/>hands wax weak he will ſtrengthen them, there ſhall be a ſecret inviſible ſtrength ſent in, that ſhall ſtill keep you waiting. O but may Souls ſay, we ſhall be weary after a while for all this. O no poor Souls you ſhall run and not be weary, walk and not faint: a poor young runner ſhall hold on, and hold out. That word in the Pſalms is of the like comfort,<note place="margin">Pſal. 27. ult.</note> to waiters, <hi>Wait on the Lord and be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thy heart.</hi> I ſay, wait on the Lord. O but ſayes the poor Soul, I am diſcouraged, I know not what to do, I ſhall ſink under them; wait on the Lord, and what then? the Lord will ſtrengthen thee in waiting againſt all thy temptations, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without; the Lord is good to them that wait for him; and thou ſhalt find it ſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord doth encourage the ſouls of young Seekers by giving them taſtes of his love; for many times, at firſt converſion he gives more of it than he doth afterwards; this is to encourage Souls, and draw them on more to love him and ſeek him, and follow after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52041:32"/>him. When the Prodigal came newly home, at his firſt return, O how he treated him! Bring forth the beſt robe, and put it on him, and a ring on his hand, and ſhooes on his feet. If the Lord ſhould not give young Seekers ſome ſweet taſtes of his love, they would be diſcouraged in ſeeking after him: But now they that taſte how good and gracious the Lord is, they come unto him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> doth encourage the Souls of young Seekers by paſſing by, and pardoning their infirmities in their approaches to him, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accepting, and owning what is his. There is ſomething of Gods, and ſomething of their own in every duty, and a great deal of their own to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> a great deal of droſs to a little ſilver, a great deal of water to a little wine; and O ſayes the poor young Seeker, I am diſcouraged, will the Lord accept of ſuch an offering as this? If thou ſhouldſt offer this to thy Governour would he accept of it? O poor Soul ſee what he ſayes, I have eaten my honey with my honey comb;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52041:33"/>not only the honey but the comb; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the droſs he doth not refuſe all; he knows how to ſeparate the comb from the droſs, the infirmities of a duty from any thing of the ſpirit in a duty; he will pick out what is his own, and pardon what is thine.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> doth encourage the Souls of young Seekers, by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to believe the precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to them. There are not more precious Promiſes made to any ſort of ſinners, or ſort of people, than to young Seekers after <hi>Christ.</hi> Is not this a precious Promiſe in the Text? Of all perſons you ſhall not be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, you ſhall ſeek and find;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>. 40.11.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall carry the Lambs in his boſome, and gather them with his arm, and ſhall gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead them that are with young.</hi> O what a Soul-reviving-Promiſe is this! are not Lambs weak creatures? but in his boſome ſhall they get both warmth and ſtrength. The old Proverb ſhall not hold in this caſe, <hi>The weakeſt go by the walls;</hi> if they cannot go, he can carry them, and not carry them on his back, but in his boſome, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52041:33"/>is the eaſieſt carriage, and the ſafeſt carriage. O what a ſweet ſhepherd is this, that nouriſhes his Lambs in his boſome! And is not that alſo a rich and glorious Promiſe, <hi>A bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break, nor ſhall he quench the ſmoaking flax, until he bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto victory.</hi> O poor Soul, can there be greater encouragements than in this Promiſe? What is a weaker thing than a bruiſed Reed? what is a poorer thing than ſmoaking flax? ſoon extinguiſhed, ſoon trodden out; but the Lord will make weak ones ſtrong, weak Grace ſhall be victorious Grace, (thou art a poor weak worm, it may be) the Lord chooſes things that are not, to confound things that are.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Lord encourages ſuch as are young Seekers of him, by watering the buddings of his own Grace in their Souls. Grace is ſo tender a plant, that it will live in no ſoyle where it is not well watered; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in any ſoyle but it muſt be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. He takes notice of the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Pomegranate, or the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52041:34"/>opening of it. When a poor ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins firſt in its openings to deſire after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in its faith, in its love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> O then theſe are watered with precious quickning influences from above, which makes them ſpring up and grow apace; he breaths upon his young plants, <hi>Blow O ſouth mind that the ſpices may flow out;</hi> theſe breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are influences from the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth encourage young Seekers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in their firſt ſetting out to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they meet with moſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. O now when Satan is like to loſe his prey, how doth this greedy Lion roar? when he ſees he is like to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, how doth he follow the Soul with wrath and rage? Now the greater the rage of Satan is againſt poor Souls, the more bowels hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> yearning towards them; as it is his great office to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> there was a great uproar. O poor Soul! thou wondreſt what is the matter, there is an uproar, a tumult in thy own Spirit, a combate within, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52041:34"/>thou begin'ſt to be reſtleſs in Spirit, &amp; look'ſt up to God in this condition. O what if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be forming in thy ſoul?</p>
               <p>There are two things make Satan beſtir himſelf againſt morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is his envy: he is the envious one, he envies the good and happineſs of every poor Soul, therefore he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His pride that his dominion ſhould be leſſened, that he ſhould loſe a ſubject, this makes him rage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth encourage poor morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe he will allure them after himſelf. This is the method of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to allure by encouragements young Converts. This the Lord did with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore I will allure her into the Wilderneſs,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her: and ſometimes it is called <hi>drawing, with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> A poor Soul, by being encouraged is allured after <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as ſome Expoſitors ſay after the manner of Lovers, that give one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſents, not only pledges, but as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52041:35"/>baits to allure and inflame further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.) Every encouragement the morning Seeker hath from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the more doth his love burn after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> doth encourage morning Seekers after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe this is the will of the Father, and whatſoever is his Fathers will, is his will: they run into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I and my Father is one.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 36.37.</note> Thus he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in that famous place, <hi>I will in no wiſe cast out them that come unto me;</hi> why, this is the will of my Father; God will have young Seekers encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; who ever be cared for in the family, the Children muſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe they are ſooneſt diſcouraged. O if poor Souls at the firſt work get not ſome little taſte of love, ſome comfort and refreſhment, alas their ſouls faint within them. That is the reaſon he will carry the Lambs in his boſome, they are ſoon wearied, cannot go, are prone to be tired, and ſit ſtill; O but this tender hearted Shepherd ſhall carry them, that is the reaſon of that Promiſe, <hi>he ſhall not quench the ſmoaking flax, (viz.)</hi> he ſhall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52041:35"/>not carry it roughly, but tenderly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Souls, under weak beginnings of Grace. The ſmoaking flax is ſoon put out, and the bruiſed Reed is ſoon broken; ſo is a poor weak young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner in Grace ſoon diſcouraged; but the Lord ſhall not do it <hi>(viz.)</hi> he will do the contrary for it, he will ſtrengthen, he will encourage it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> doth encourage young morning Seekers after himſelf, becauſe it is his own work in their Souls, and he that begins a good work will carry it on. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt needs encourage the breathings of his own Spirit in the Soul; he is tender of his own begettings: every Creature that begets, ſeeks to maintain that life, ſo doth <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is called the New Creature, it is of his Creation; we are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip created to good works in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> God will encourage his own workmanſhip.</p>

               <p>Is it ſo that poor morning Seekers

               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

O this is an evil frame of heart, you ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> is very loth you ſhould be diſcouraged.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This deſponding and being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, argues much ſhortneſs and impatience of ſpirit in you, that you are not willing to let the Lord alone with the management of his own

               <p n="2">2. Doth not this ſpeak much pride to be in the heart? What is it but pride, that you are not willing to wait?

And this is alſo the duty of others, Fathers and Mothers, when you ſee any thing of Jeſus breaking out, any deſires, any good inclinations, any convictions of ſin; O you ſhould encourage theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, this is <hi>Chriſt</hi>-like, and the contrary is Devil-like, <hi>Herod</hi>-like, which undoubtedly was ſtirred up by Satan to kill <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the cradle <hi>(viz.)</hi> while young, to ſeek for the life of the young Child; <hi>Pharoah</hi>-like to throw the Male Children into the River; Phariſee-like neither to enter your ſelves, nor let others enter. Maſters, how ſhould they encourage their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when they ſee any thing of <hi>Christ</hi> appear in them. The day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you &amp; your ſervants will ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord to give an account how you have carried it towards them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have encouraged them or no; and I am afraid the evidence of ſome Servants will be received againſt their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52041:37"/>Maſters. Are not ſuch Maſters mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, rather than Maſters, as ſhall way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the ſalvation of a ſervants Soul? Would not the rich man have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the coming of his brethren to hell? What can there be any love to Souls in hell? (Expoſitors tell us, that their going thither would have added to his torments, becauſe by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they had ſinned.) O will not this add to your torments, and miſery in another world, that you have been the occaſion of ſo many poor Souls miſcarrying under your roof?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It informs us of the infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he will look after poor young enquirers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poor morning Seekers. Is not this condeſcention even to admiration, to carry Lambs in his arms, to nouriſh poor Lambs in his own boſome? that he ſhould trouble himſelf with ſuch poor ſinful worms? May not ſuch ſouls ſay, how is it Lord that thou ſhould manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not to the world, and not to the reſt of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not to the reſt of my ſiſters, and not to the reſt of my relations?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52041:38"/>2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the encourager of poor morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seekers after himſelf? Then it is a <hi>word of Comfort</hi> to young Seekers. Be of good cheer, as they ſaid to the blind man, <hi>for the Lord calleth;</hi> for the Lord encourages you. O all you morning Seekers, be of good courage, and wait on the Lord, and he will ſtrengthen your hearts; I ſay wait upon the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be of good comfort, you are the travail of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Soul, and therefore he will look after you. His ſuffering was his travail. O the pangs and throwes of a travailing woman! We ſay ſuch have hard labour. O you poor young Converts, inquirers after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he hath had hard labour for you. O the pangs of his Fathers diſpleaſure, that he hath endured, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Here was one bitter pang, and his Soul was ſorrowful unto death: There was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other pang, and throwes came upon him ſo faſt, that he died travailing for the Salvation and Redemption of poor Sinners. Therefore we read that ſweet
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52041:38"/>word, <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10, 11.</note> he ſhall have Seed come out of his ſufferings, which are called the travail of his Soul. And is not this a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? He will ſurely encourage his own travail: O poor Souls he hath travailed for you; therefore he will encourage you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Second word of Comfort to young Seekers is this, you are his joy, his delight, <hi>He ſhall ſee the travail of his Soul, and be ſatisfied, (viz.)</hi> it ſhall be matter of great contentation and delight to ſee his ſufferings iſſue, in the bringing forth a Seed and Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that ſhall be ſaved. As one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his children, ſo doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his young Seekers, <hi>Behold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I and the Children thou haſt given me</hi> (which is ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and quoted out of the Prophets.) He rejoyces, you ſee, in his Seed. O what joy was there when the young prodigal returned home to his Father's. The whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preaches this Doctrine. A man delights in his youngeſt children. As a man delights in his nurſery, ſo doth <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his garden; he hath his young nurſery.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52041:39"/>3. Word of Comfort to young Seekers, He hath accommodated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſuit with the conditions of ſuch. O what a care had <hi>Chriſt</hi> of ſuch, that he would give Promiſes on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſuch? As to their weakneſs in Grace, he would ſtrengthen ſuch poor bruiſed reeds; as to the diſpenſations of God, which they fear they are not able to keep pace with, <hi>He ſhall carry the Lambs in his boſome;</hi> they cannot go they are ſo weak, he ſhall carry them. As for the temptations within or without, <hi>Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings, he ſhall ordain ſtrength,</hi> to ſtill the enemy, and the avenger. There is not any condition, but you may find a Promiſe accommodated for that condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Word of Comfort to morning Seekers, You are <hi>Chriſts</hi> charge; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I and the Children thou haſt given me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1.13. <hi>Spoken of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </note> Now upon the Fathers donation, and the Sons acceptation they begin to be his charge; therefore he is the great Truſtee for poor Souls. He ſtands engaged to give his Father an account of them all at the laſt day; and will
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52041:39"/>not <hi>Chriſt</hi> be faithful to his truſt? nay to the truſt God the Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him? Therefore he loſes not a ſoul. They paſs under the hand of him that tells them again; all that God the Father hath told out to his Son, the Son tells back again to God the Father.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Word of Comfort to morning Seekers is this, This argues the great love God bears to your Souls, to call you betimes, to call you while you are young. O how many go down to Hell, while the milk is in their breaſts and marrow in their bones! though young in years, yet old in ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O at what a rate do ſome young ones ſin? How expert are they grown in that curſed trade? And that thou ſhould'ſt be called to ſeek after <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thy young dayes, O what a comfort is this! Here is one taken and another left.</p>
               <p>O but ſayes a poor Soul, Alas! I can get no comfort, as yet I am a poor troubled Soul, much caſt down and dejected.</p>
               <p>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52041:40"/>joy; it is thy ſeed-time now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt not expect a crop pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, the Seed muſt lie in the ground. Let your Seed-prayers, and Seed-tears lie in Gods hand a while; <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O but ſayes a poor Soul, I am fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with temptations, ſince that I begun to ſeek after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and I know not what to do.</p>
               <p>Poor Soul, his rage is great, becauſe his time is ſhort; now thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of captivity to him, he is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thee to reduce thee to the old houſe of bondage; thy temptations do argue, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout caſting out of Satan; therefore he is angry.</p>
               <p>O but I am a poor needy creature;<note place="margin">Pſal. 40. ult.</note> well, but doth not the Lord think of thee?</p>
               <p>O but I am a weak Creature.</p>
               <p>He will perfect ſtrength in weakneſs, <hi>out of the mouth of Babes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O but I am an ignorant Creature.</p>
               <p>Well, he can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and them that are out of the way.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52041:40"/>
               <p>The laſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to Young Ones, to ſeek the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and make ſupplication to him. If thou ſeek early after God, the Word is, <hi>Thou ſhalt find him.</hi> Remember your Creator in the dayes of your youth,<note place="margin">Job 8.5. <hi>The word</hi> Seeking <hi>we find u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places:</hi> Significat quaerere diligenter &amp; cum cura.

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Leave all for Chriſt, ſell all for the pearl of price. Seek him while he is to be found.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Obſervation</hi> we are now come unto from the words, is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That morning Seekers ſhall be ſure and certain finders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that ſeek me early ſhall find me; to be ſure ſuch find me; whoever miſs of me, they ſhall not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By morning Seekers is meant,<note place="margin">Job 8.5. Shahar aurare ſeu diluculare <hi>ſignifies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to ſeek, or riſe timely in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Prov. 11.27.</note> one that ſeeks the Lord betimes. So <hi>Job</hi> phraſes it, <hi>If thou ſeek the Lord, and make ſupplication unto him.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our Creator in the dayes of our youth. Our youth is our morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> in; our age is our afternoon: now it is not ſo good ſeeking in the middle of the day, nor in the afternoon, as it is in the morning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By morning Seekers are meant, ſuch as do earneſtly ſeek the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52041:41"/>Are there any poor Souls that do more earneſtly ſeek the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> than ſuch as give up themſelves betimes to <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.15.</note> 
                  <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early;</hi> (viz.) they will ſeek me earneſtly, they will ſeek me in the morning; becauſe what is done in the morning is done with moſt vigour and fervency. O! morning Seekers, how vigorouſly in Soul do they ſeek the Lord Jeſus? they do not ſeek like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> ſluggard, as though they cared not whether they found or no; but they ſeek with all their heart, which we read a Promiſe made to;<note place="margin">Jer. 29.13.</note> 
                  <hi>And you ſhall ſeek me, and find me, when you ſhall ſearch for me with all your hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By a morning Seeker of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is meant a ſoul that the Lord is viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the day of his power. The morning is the beginning of the day, ſo the morning is the beginning of the work of Grace.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.3.</note> The morning of a day of Grace we read of; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God prepared as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The morning light is gradual, ſo is the dawnings of the day of Grace upon the Soul;<note place="margin">Pro. 4.18.</note> as that word is, <hi>The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52041:41"/>path of the Juſt is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day.</hi> There is the dawning of the day, and the perfect day. When the day-ſtar from on High firſt ariſeth in the ſoul; this is the morning Seeker, it had not light to ſeek by, until the day-ſtar aroſe in the heart; and now morning light is come in to let the ſoul ſee the miſery of its dark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done eſtate without Chriſt. O now it is a ſeeker in this light after the Lord Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By a morning Seeker is meant, a Soul waiting for more appearances, more ariſings of the day-ſtar in and upon the Soul:<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.6.</note> As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My Soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that wait for the morning;</hi> more than the watchmen that wait for the morning. And thus, as ſoon as poor Babes in Grace are begotten to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are children of the <hi>light.</hi> All <hi>young</hi> Converts are children of the light; they are looking out for more light, more light of Grace, and more light of Comfort. Thus doth a poor morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seeker wait for light to ſhine into his dark heart.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52041:42"/>5. By a morning Seeker is meant, a poor Soul that ſtands upon the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower of Obſervation, taking notice of the firſt breakings in of light: as the watchmen waited for the firſt peep and dawning of the day, that they might offer the ſacrifice appointed for the morning. So a poor morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is one that obſerves the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions that dawn upon it, the firſt light of the ſpirit that ſhines into it; and it ſtands by the creviſe and will not away; but here is ſuch an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that God firſt convinced me by, firſt illuminated me. And thus the Soul keeps an obſervation of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual breakings in of light.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By morning Seekers is meant, a poor Soul in its firſt breathings, out of the deſires and wants of the Soul to <hi>Christ;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning. In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> Here is the morning, a time for prayer. I will order my prayer in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the morning of a begun work of Grace, O what directing is there of prayer to God? A praying Soul is a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52041:42"/>morning Seeker. Alas! the Soul pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not before, but now a day of Grace hath viſited it, it may be ſaid of him, <hi>behold he prays.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. By morning Seekers is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, a Soul that looks out for ſome encouragement by way of anſwer to prayer. In the morning will I direct my prayer and look up (the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, diligently to look out for ſomething that is coming towards us.) O! a morning Seeker enquires for ſome anſwer to prayer, ſome encouragement to animate it in its purſuits after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, By a morning Seeker is meant, one that ſeeks with hope and joy, that ſeeks chearfully in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to find. The Spirits are moſt chearful in the morning. O how it glads the poor weary Centinel to think of the approaching day! Thus it is with a poor Soul ſeeking <hi>Chriſt;</hi> O thinks this Soul, ſorrow may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a night, but joy comes in the morning.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why early or morning
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52041:43"/>Seekers ſhall be ſure and certain find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe ſuch are importunate Seekers, and it is importunate pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is prevailing prayer with God; therefore we read that Parable teaching Souls how to ſeek; for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he aroſe and gave him;<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> the word is <hi>(Impudence;)</hi> there is a holy Impudence that will not be ſaid nay. O! this God loves in all Seekers, but eſpecially in morning Seekers, they are uſually importunate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Young Seekers have ſtrong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to combate with. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of youth are ſtrong; and when ſtrong corruptions meet with ſtrong convictions, how ſhould a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace live in the Soul but by importunate ſeeking <hi>Chriſt?</hi> The ſtronger the corruption, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate the wreſtling of the Soul under it; ſtrong corruptions where there is a begun work of Grace, cauſe the ſoul to put forth ſtrong crys and ſupplications.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſually morning Seekers are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Seekers, becauſe they have ſtrong temptations. We read of <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52041:43"/>writing to young men,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Epiſt. of</hi> Joh. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>I write unto you young men, becauſe you are ſtrong, and have overcome the wicked one.</hi> Then young Seekers are combatants not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their own corruptions, but the wicked ones temptations. <hi>Paul,</hi> when a meſſenger of Satan was ſent him to buffet him, what did he do? He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice, <hi>(viz.)</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently or importunately. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will put upon importunate Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord Jeſus, where there is a principle of Grace in the Soul. O are not young mens temptations ſtronger than others? The temptations of young men to vain company, O how hard to overcome is this! hath not this one temptation been the Rock that many a young man hath ſplit his Soul on for ever? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſetting out the ſinful ſtate of youth, being led by the ſtrange woman, ſayes, <hi>I diſcerned a young man void of underſtanding;</hi> but where was he?<note place="margin">Prov. 7.7.</note> The Text tells you, amongſt the <hi>Simple Ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Morning Seekers are importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Seekers, they are in their firſt love. Love will be importunate; <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52041:44"/>the kindneſs of thy youth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and the love of thine Eſpouſals.</hi> Their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Morning Seekers are importunate ſeekers, their convictions are ſtrong. Now where there are ſtrong convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there will be importunate Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; morning convictions are ſtrong convictions. O now the power of the Lord takes hold of the heart; and conviction is born in upon the Soul, that it ſtoops under it. Thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke;<note place="margin">Jer. 31.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>I was aſhamed, yea confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> O what ſtrong convictions are here! and what now doth poor <hi>Ephraim</hi> do? He mourns and prays, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Morning Seekers are importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Seekers, their oppoſitions are greater and ſtronger than others; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions within and without. Now where there is a principle of Grace, when under oppoſition, it will ſeek ſo much the more importunately after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Diſciples diſcouraged the poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Send
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52041:44"/>her away;</hi> a great diſcouragement, but ſhe cryed the more: Oppoſition meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Grace doth but prove like cold water upon good coales, make them burn the brighter. Uſually at thy firſt looking out after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition will meet thee; but then let ſuch oppoſition ſend you to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why morning Seekers ſhall be certain finders, becauſe they are diligent Seekers, and the Promiſe runs unto diligent ſeeking; <hi>He that comes unto God,</hi>

                  <hi>muſt believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of ſuch as diligently ſeek him.</hi> It is not the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Seeker that ſhall be the certain finder; no, no, the deſire of the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard kills him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Morning Seekers are diligent Seekers, now they ſee the worth of what they ſeek, none can ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently but ſuch. O now they ſeek the Lord Jeſus in the ſenſe of the worth of him. When we know the worth of that we ſeek, we will ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. Ask theſe Seekers what <hi>Chriſt</hi> is worth, and they will tell you ten thouſand worlds; he is the pearl of

               <p n="2">2. Morning Seekers are diligent ſeekers, becauſe now they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the worth of their Souls, for the good of which they ſeek. Perſons will never ſeek diligently, until they come to ſee the preciouſneſs of their immortal ſouls. Can a man be too di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the buſineſs of his Soul? Did ever you hear of any repented them of their diligence in working out of their ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling when they came to die? Have you ever known any who have cryed out, what a fool was I, to pray ſo much, to live ſo holily, to take up ſo much of my time about my immortal ſoul? Ask a poor Soul, why it is ſo diligent at firſt ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and it will tell you, I never ſaw the worth of my Soul before, I am now ſeeking out for my Soul, and if I do not find, I am a loſt, undone Soul to all Eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Morning Seekers are diligent Seekers, becauſe they now know the evil dayes are coming upon them,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.1.</note> in which they will be unfit to ſeek him; dayes of ſickneſs, dayes of affliction, it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52041:45"/>may be, temptations and tryals; they ſeek while it is to day, becauſe when night comes, there will be no ſeeking.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They know there is a day in which he will not be found,<note place="margin">Iſa. 99.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is nigh.</hi> O ſayes the morning Seeker, the time is coming when it will be too late, the gate of Mercy will be ſhut, the bridge of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy drawn, and the Soul is afraid of delaying, and dallying upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Morning Seekers are diligent Seekers, becauſe they are convinced now of the great need of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O now they ſee, and ſay they are undone and loſt for ever, if they miſs of the Lord Jeſus. What makes perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ſeeking but when they ſee a need of what they ſeek? Do not they need a <hi>Christ,</hi> that ſee they are undone to all Eternity if they have not a <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why morning Seekers will be certain finders; the Promiſe runs to them: what plainer than this word in my Text, <hi>They ſhall find me,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52041:46"/>They that ſeek ſhall find.</hi> He never ſaid to the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeek ye my face in vain. And he is faithful that hath promiſed. Let this encourage you, that you are under a Promiſe.</p>

               <p>Is it ſo that morning Seekers ſhall be ſure and certain finders? Then it is a word of <hi>Inquiry;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, or what ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo many poor morning Seekers are complaining they find not him whom their Souls love? as the Spouſe did, <hi>I ſought him, but I found him not.</hi> And ſo many poor Souls are complaining, I ſought <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo long, but I know not that I have found him to this day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why Jeſus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not at preſent found of morning Seekers, he will exerciſe their Graces by it; he had a deſign upon the Spouſe to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her Grace, by withdrawing from her.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sayes <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I will try whether this poor Soul love me or no; Love is a waiting Grace; whether this poor
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52041:46"/>Soul can wait, and enquire; <hi>Saw you him whom my Soul loves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> by this tryes their faith; faith will continue ſeeking, though at preſent it doth not find.<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.17.</note> 
                  <hi>I wait upon the Lord who hides his face from the houſe of Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus is not found at preſent of morning Seekers, to draw out their Souls in longings after him. The more a poor ſeeker of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeems to be denied, the more is his Soul enflamed with ardent deſires. Thus did <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the Spouſe when he had withdrawn himſelf; the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſmote her, took away her veil from her: Yet her Spirit was raiſed the more after <hi>Chriſt</hi> to enquire after him. Thus often it is with morning Seekers after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord Jeſus is not at preſent found of morning Seekers, becauſe he will let the Soul ſee it is only his free Grace that muſt be adored and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in finding <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would be ſacrificing elſe to their nets, and doſing incenſe to their own drags, and ſtroaking ſelf upon the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52041:47"/>head, and ſaying, this is my praying, this is my mourning, this is my being early up in the morning. O now he will have the Soul know, that it is of the riches of his Grace, that he is found of thoſe that ſeek him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not found at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of morning Seekers, becauſe he will try whether their hearts be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with himſelf. Many poor Souls begin to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but it is but for a time, temporary ſeekers, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they are offended with one thing or other, then they draw back; that is a note of a rotten heart. I dare ſay thou wert never right at heart Chriſt-ward that turneſt off, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt back, upon ſome offence taken againſt Chriſt. I doubt there be many hypocritical Seekers; it is no wonder if ſuch be not finders.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not at preſent found of morning Seekers, becauſe they are many times too legal in their ſeeking him; I mean, they ſeek him too much in a way of works, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old did. Now he would acquaint poor Souls with the way of faith, to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52041:47"/>ſeek him in a way of believing; this is the only way of ſeeking <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Word of <hi>Inquiry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that morning Seekers ſhall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain finders of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then how comes it to paſs, that ſo many of them after a while give over, turn their backs on the way of God, and apoſtatize from that they once profeſt? O how many young ones who have begun in the Spirit, and yet have ended in the fleſh, as we might judge!</p>
               <p n="1">1. Many young Seekers have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off from ſeeking <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe they were never truly numbled for ſin. In their firſt ſeeking him, ſome tranſient convictions it may be they had, but never truly humbled for ſin, O young ones look to this, or elſe all your affections and deſires will come to nothing; you will ſee no worth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no need of <hi>Christ,</hi> if you be not truly humbled for ſin.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.5, 6.</note> We read of that ground that had no root, and what became of it? it withered. That houſe that digged not deep to lay the foundation, what became of it?<note place="margin">Luk. 6. ult.</note> it fell, and great was the fall of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:52041:48"/>2. Many young Seekers go off from ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they never ſee any real worth and excellency in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They have had it may be ſome flaſhes of affection, but they never ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be diſtinctly precious to their poor Souls. Have you ever ſeen him to be the pearl of price, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand? Can ſuch ſouls, who have fallen really in love with <hi>Chriſt</hi> fall off again? Did thou ever ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> a ſpiritual <hi>Chriſt?</hi> It may be thou haſt lookt upon him as a carnal <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and haſt known him, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>after the fleſh;</hi> made only a notional <hi>Chriſt</hi> of him, or an hiſtorical <hi>Christ</hi> of him; O then it is no wonder if thou fall off from ſeeking of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Many morning Seekers turn off from ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe profeſſion grows too hot for them, becauſe of the heat of the day. O it is fine tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the morning, but after a while, the Sun gets up, and then it is with them, as with that ground which by and by was offended when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution aroſe. Travellers take in, in the heat of the day; ſo I doubt do many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52041:48"/>poor young ones, that have ſet fairly out after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Many poor young Seekers fall off from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they never truly and really cloſed with him. Alas! it is not your ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but your cloſing in with <hi>Christ,</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from falling off. Have you choſen the Lord Jeſus, and received him? Cloſing with him, is called,<note place="margin">Job. 1.12.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him, <hi>to as many as received him.</hi> A poor Soul may be a ſeeker of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is not a receiver of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Many morning Seekers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> fall off again, becauſe they come after <hi>Christ</hi> with ſome reſerve. If you will be thus ſeekers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you ſhall fall off at one time or other, <hi>(viz.)</hi> I mean, if you will reſerve any luſt. Thus the young man came on to ſome terms with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the market ſoon fell, when he was told, he muſt ſell all; and <hi>Judas</hi> followed <hi>Chriſt</hi> with a reſerve; uſually reſerves are ſinners ruine: <hi>Turn from all iniquity</hi> (ſaid the Prophet) <hi>leſt it be your ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Many morning Seekers fall off again, becauſe they ſeek him for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52041:49"/>and not for himſelf; and many do thus, that are not aware of it: this is but to bring forth fruit to your ſelves (as <hi>Ephraim</hi> is charged with.)<note place="margin">Hoſ. 10.1.</note> Do you ſee any lovelineſs in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> any comlineſs in him? Is he a plant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown to you? Many ſeek him for loaves, though in a more refined ſence than there ſpoken of, for his comforts, for his diſcoveries of love, for his ſmiles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford.</note> 
                  <hi>I am more taken</hi> (ſayes one) <hi>with my Lords manifeſted love, than with himſelf.</hi> This is to love him for what comes from him; for his tokens.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Many morning Seekers fall off again, becauſe they let other lovers in proceſs of time ſteal away their hearts. Many in the dayes of their youth have ſought after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but after a while the heart hath been ſtrangely and inſenſibly gone, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons loſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> not in all his thoughts, why, what is the matter? The world it may be hath won in upon the ſoul, or gaming, or ſome other ſin; and now the Soul falls off, as new ſuiters come on. O poor young ones, you will have many ſuiters, many will court
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52041:49"/>you, and then you will be in danger.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next word of <hi>Inquiry;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If that morning Seekers ſhall be ſure finders, how comes it to paſs, the Lord Jeſus hath ſo few Seekers? One would think <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would be thronged after; as in the dayes when he was in the fleſh, they thronged about the door where he was. Alas! poor Souls, you may throng about Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and Meetings, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come near <hi>Chriſt.</hi> We read of a whole crowd about <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet but one poor Woman touched him to draw vertue from him. You may crowd about <hi>Christ</hi> in an Ordinance, and yet draw not one drop of vertue from him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hindrance to young ones ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are not convinced of the miſery of their diſtant ſtate from <hi>Christ;</hi> if young ones or old ones were convinced of this, if all were convinced throughly of their miſery of lying out from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> O what cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what mourning, what running, nay, what roaring after <hi>Chriſt</hi> would there be? One poor young man would
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52041:50"/>run up and down, crying, none but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> none but <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Another would run to every Ordinance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring (with the Spouſe) ſaw you him whom my Soul loves? And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would run to a poor Miniſter with this cry, Sir, I am an undone ſoul, if there were no more ſouls in the world, if a <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not my portion. Another would cry, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Methinks I ſee how the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites</hi> run up and down when the fiery Serpents had ſtung them, crying, O where, where is the brazen Serpent, that I may get a look at him and be healed? So would poor Souls convinced of their miſery do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poor Soul, that lies in thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Christ,</hi> did thou ever ſee thy miſery?</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thy miſery of guilt, as thou art an unpardoned Soul. Is not guilt a miſerable thing to lie upon a poor Creatures conſcience? Ask the Devils and they will tell thee, if guilt be not an intolerable burden: Ask the damned ſpirits, and they will preach to thee, the miſery of unpardoned
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52041:50"/>guilt. Nay, if thou could talk with a deſpairing Soul, O what terrible things would it tell thee, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of unpardoned guilt! O poor young man, haſt thou found out the way to a pardon and leave out <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Angels could never find out ſuch a way. Or doſt thou think to carry guilt into Glory with thee? Muſt any be ſaved, but ſuch as God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? If thou didſt ſee the miſery of guilt, thou would'ſt be a Seeker, and a morning Seeker after <hi>Chriſt?</hi> All pardons are purchaſed and drawn up and preached in his name: They are purchaſed; we have redemption, and remiſſion of ſin; but how come they in? through his blood; <hi>And they preached Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins in his Name, beginning at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Poor Soul, haſt thou ſeen the miſery of thy diſtant ſtate, as thou art under the power of ſin, as every ſoul is that is out of <hi>Christ?</hi> And O what a ſad ſight is a young perſon in under the power of ſtrong corruption? Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thee that thou art a ſlave to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52041:51"/>ſin, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures? But when was this they did ſo? the Apoſtle tells us, before the loving kindneſs of God their Saviour did appear.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.4, 5.</note> Would'ſt thou have power againſt ſin? It may be thy Soul goes to thy prayers for it, to thy duties for it, to thy reſolutions and purpoſes for it; the beſt way is to cloſe with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for there can be no power againſt ſin that can ſubdue it, until cloſure with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> While thou art under the power of ſin, it doth what it will with thee; it Kings it, and Lords it, that thou obey'ſt it in the luſt thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Haſt thou ſeen the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thy diſtant ſtate, as thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enmity to God, and God under enmity to thee?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The enmity of thy ſide; O what a piece of miſery is it, to be under the power of enmity? this is a piece of the miſery of the damned, they have an inveterate enmity againſt God, that if ſuch a thing were poſſible, they would dethrone God; like ſome, we read in their diſtreſs,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſe their God, and their King, and look upward.</hi> Is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52041:51"/>not this miſery indeed, to be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the God of all thy mercies, to be an enemy to him thou daily liveſt upon, nay, cannot live one moment without? And ſuch a monſter art thou. I have read of one that killed her Child, while it ſmiled; ſo would'ſt thou do. Art not thou ſpurning Gods tender bowels every day? but now by ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or cloſing with <hi>Chriſt</hi> this enmity is done away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Enmities on Gods ſide; God an enemy to thee, and can there be greater miſery than this? what, he thy enemy, that thou art every day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, and can upon every provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a moment turn thee into Hell? Every one fears having great ones for their enemies, but what ſayſt thou to the great God, who is thine enemy? If ever poor ſinners were convinced of this, O what ſeeking <hi>Chriſt</hi> would there be for reconciliation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Haſt thou ſeen the miſery of thy diſtant ſtate, as thou art a vaſſal to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, for ſo is every one out of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and is this nothing to thee? Wert thou in <hi>Algier,</hi> what Letters wouldſt thou ſend
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52041:52"/>to thy friends! ſetting forth thy dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſlavery to affect their hearts, to ſend over thy redemption-money? But alas! what is a Turk to the Devil? the one reaches the Body, the other the Soul. Poor Soul out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Devil is thy patron, and wilt not thou groan to be delivered? Why are not Souls morning Seekers after <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Alas! they ſee not the miſery of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the power of Satan. Now want of powerful convictions in theſe three things while you lye in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtate from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the firſt cauſe why he hath ſo few Seekers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hinderance to young Seekers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is, their beloved luſts, and darling corruptions: they are willing to part with ſome, but not all their luſts; there is an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that cauſes laughter, they cannot think of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the throat of it; there is a <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> they cannot tell how to let that go; there is a <hi>Dalilah</hi> they are loth to loſe; there is an <hi>Herodias</hi> they cannot endure to part with;<note place="margin">Mat. 13.45, 46.</note> a right hand they will needs keep, and hide. O no, poor young man, thou muſt ſell
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52041:52"/>all, if thou wilt ſeek and find this pearl of price. We read of the young man, and he was very fair and like to fall in with <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 10.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> begins to ſtrike at his right hand, and he pulls it in, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and he parts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion. <hi>Herod</hi> was fair, but when <hi>John</hi> gets a blow at his <hi>Herodias, Herod</hi> gets a blow at <hi>Johns</hi> head, and ſtrikes it off. O poor ſinner, if thou reſolve for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thou muſt reſolve againſt thy darling ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hinderance to young Seekers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is, their entanglement by wicked company. They come to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and are convinced, that ſin will be bitter to them in the latter end; and they ſee no way but that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying in ſuch courſes they are loſt for ever. Well, one would think ſome good would ſpring and grow out of ſuch convictions; but alas! the next time they come in their evil company, they have abſolutely loſt all; one would not think theſe were the young men that were ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at Sermons: Now it may be, you may ſee in their hands inſtead of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52041:53"/>their Bibles, their Cups; and in their mouths hear inſtead of their prayers, their oaths. Well, young men, know for all this God will bring you into judgement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wilt thou poor Soul rather part with a precious <hi>Christ,</hi> than with thy baſe company? O unworthy Soul of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bowels! to prefer thy ſinful Companions before thy Bleſſed Jeſus; as thoſe poor Souls preferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Jeſus. What wilt thou love a drunkard, a ſwearer, an unclean wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Wilt thou rather part with an immortal precious Soul, than part with thy wicked company? O how many have been damned by this one ſin! how many thouſands of Souls have been caſt away for ever upon this rock! while other ſins have ſlain their thouſands, this hath ſlain ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. O how many company-keepers are now in Hell!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then canſt thou look upon them when thou comeſt to dye, and thy conſcience filled with guilt and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? canſt thou then look upon them
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52041:53"/>with delight? Canſt thou ſport thy ſelf with thinking or diſcourſing how many times you have been drunk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, how many times you have violated the Lords day together, how many nights you have ſpent all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together? If your Companions ſhould come in, when you are upon a death bed, and ſay, Come be of good cheer, remember ſuch a bout, and ſuch a bout, how merry we were. O will not this be as a dagger to ſtab through your heart, will not this wound like a ſword in the bones? Remember the young mans doleful ditty in the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> and thou mourn at laſt when thy fleſh and thy body is conſumed, and ſay,<note place="margin">Prov. 5.11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>How have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Will not your wicked examples one to another here, be aggravations of one anothers torments in another world?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Poor Souls, if you will go to Hell for company, you ſhall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany enough there. What company is there there? There is the Devils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52041:54"/>and wicked Spirits company. As bleſſed Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaid in a good ſence, ſo here may be ſaid in a ſad ſence, <hi>I ſhall change my place, but not my company:</hi> So thou mayeſt ſay, thou muſt change Earth for Hell, but not thy company, there is wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany enough there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourth hinderance to young Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a ſpirit of ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they indulge themſelves too much in their own eaſe, as the Spouſe did, but this provoked <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and he did withdraw upon it. Poor Sinner, what man that hath been induſtrious, that by pains and care hath gotten an eſtate, afterwards repents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but rather looks back upon his diligence with delight? So, did you ever hear of any when they were to dye, that ever cryed out, O that I had not ſpent ſo many dayes in the ſervice of God! O that I had never taken ſuch pains in ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt!</hi> But you have heard of many on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that have cryed, O that I were to live over my dayes and time again! would I ever be ſo careleſs of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52041:54"/>Soul? would I ever indulge my carnal ſloth at that rate I have done? would I miſs ſo many precious ſeaſons of Grace for my Soul as I have done?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poor Soul, do not many ſtrive and never win into the harbour? had not thou need caſt off thy ſloth then?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Work out thy ſalvation with fear and trembling;</hi> who then would give way to fleſh?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a buſineſs of eternal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, who would be ſlothful in a buſineſs of ſuch great concernment?</p>
               <p n="4">4. All our diligence is little enough; therefore God calls for violence in the caſe, to take heaven by violence, this is honourable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fruit of diligence will be peace upon a death bed.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Be diligent</hi> is <hi>Peters</hi> exhortation; but what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive doth he uſe? <hi>That you may be found of him in peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifth hinderance to young Seekers after <hi>Chriſt</hi> is hope of a longer leaſe of their lives, they hope there is no ſuch haſt: Some years hence, when they have gotten an eſtate in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52041:55"/>world, then they will look after theſe things; but why ſhould they be ſo early with <hi>Chriſt?</hi> will not two ſeven years hence ſerve? and thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is worth conſidering; what if thou do live longer and be hardened in ſin? While Plants are tender they may be dealt with, but when they are grown, they are too ſturdy. Alas poor Sinner! thou mayſt be hereafter a ſturdy ſinner, an hardned ſinner, an Atheiſt, a Scoffer, a Perſecutor, what if God ſhall give thee up after thou haſt refuſed to hearken unto him, and ſay of thee,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11, 12.</note> as of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>But Iſrael would have none of me, ſo I gave them up to their own hearts luſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not worth conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the motions of the Spirit be not irrecoverably forfeited by ſuch Souls as delay ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon hope of a longer day. There have been Souls that have irrecoverably forfeited the Spirits gales; and then what a ſad condition would thy poor Soul be in? God hath ſaid, his Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52041:55"/>3. What if while thou art hoping for a longer day, God ſhould ſend thee a ſummons, by the black Serjeant Death, to tell thee, this night ſhall thy Soul be taken away? It was ſo with him, while he was ſaying, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. What if thy day of Grace ſhould be over, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> wooe no more, tender himſelf no more, but his abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed love turn into incenſed wrath?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, how thy puts off, and delayes have grieved <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Haſt not thou wearied out the Lord Jeſus, while he hath ſtretched his arm all the day long?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, how your delays will ſting you upon a death bed, or in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world. O how often was I call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet delayed! The remembrance of every delay, will go to your hearts like a dagger, and bleed in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for ever.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixth Hinderance to morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is, perſwaſions of <hi>Chriſts</hi> unwillingneſs to receive them, or be found of them, becauſe of their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52041:56"/>unworthineſs. This very caſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages many a poor Soul from ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they have taken in hard thoughts of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And O how doth Satan now haunt the Soul, taking all opportunities to blow up their unbelieving jealouſies againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Poor Soul, would <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wooe thee, if he were not willing to be found of thee? Would he knock, if he were not willing to come in upon thy opening? Would he hold out his Golden Scepter for thee to kiſs, if he were not willing to be reconciled to thee?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Poor Soul, would he wait if he were not willing? What ſpeaks his great patience and long ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, but his willingneſs to be found of thee? Why doth he not only knock, but ſtand and knock; <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> He is not yet gone from your doors, which notes his willingneſs to be in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Poor Soul, would he complain of poor Sinners unwillingneſs to receive him, if he were not willing? If it ſtick
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52041:56"/>not on the ſinners ſide, there then is no ground for complaining on <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſide. O the ſad complaints and groans that have proceeded from <hi>Chriſt</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account! <hi>You will not come unto me, that ye might have life. He was grieved becauſe of their unbelief, and hardneſs of their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Poor Soul, would the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſend his voice behind thee, ſo often prompting thee on to ſeek after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if he were not willing? O how doth the voice ſtill keep behind thee, in Ordinances, in Afflictions whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee thy duty? We read of the Spirit, ſaying, <hi>Come,</hi> as well as the Bride ſaying <hi>Come;</hi> it is the Spirit of God is the great maker up of the match, betwixt the Soul and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and this argues <hi>Christ</hi> is willing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſends his meſſenger ſo often to thee upon the errand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Poor Soul, would the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> have been ſo willing to come a Salvation-errand into the world, if he were not willing to be found of Sinners? What was <hi>Chriſts</hi> errand from Heaven unto Earth? He came
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52041:57"/>to ſeek Souls, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; <hi>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Would he ſeek you, if not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſave you? O let not <hi>Chriſt</hi> loſe his pains, by your harbouring unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving jealouſies of his love!</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seventh hinderance to morning Seekers after <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is, they hope they may repent upon a death bed, or ſick bed, after they have ſpent their youthful time in ſin and vanity; this is very incident to all, but eſpecially to young perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poor Soul, what if the grim Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Death ſerve a Writ on thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares? If thou be ſtruck on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain where then will be thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Doſt thou know the manner of thy death, any more than the time of death? What if thou poor young man, who haſt ſlighted ſo many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhouldſt have none given thee when the great ſtroak comes? What if the Lord come upon thee in an hour thou lookedſt not for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if thou be given up to a ſeared conſcience, on a ſick bed, or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52041:57"/>death bed? A ſeared conſcience at any time is ſad, but moſt ſad on a ſick bed; have not many died ſeared and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſin, yea in their very youth? But as they lived ſo they died, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſe or feeling of their ſad and ſinful ſtate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Poor Souls, what if your repentance then will not go with God? I think ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, you may well have ſuch <hi>jealouſies,</hi> that your repentance is hypocritical, while it is thus forced and extorted from you, by reaſon of your fears and horrours that now walk in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. There is a great deal of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit repentance that God will not take when you come to die; late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſeldome true: and is it not a pitty (as one obſerves) to play the Courtiers with your own Souls? They do all things late, they go to bed late, and riſe late, and dine late, and ſup late, and worſt of all, repent late.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What if thy poor Conſcience ſhould now cry, it is too late, thou ſhouldſt have done it ſooner? Many have thus cryed out, O no there is no
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52041:58"/>mercy for them, they have ſtood it out too long, and now they cannot expect any thing at Gods hand, but a righteous ſentence of ſeparation for ever from his comfortable face.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Poor Soul, how will it ſting thee to conſider thou might often have done it in a fitter time, when thou put it off. Is not a time of health the fitteſt time for repentance? O now how will the conſideration of thy many calls, and many refuſals lie heavy upon thee!</p>
               <p n="8">8. Eighth hinderance to poor morning Seekers againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the prejudice that Satan labours to fill their Souls with againſt <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this is very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to young perſons, to take up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Satan labours to prejudice them by the paucity and fewneſs of thoſe that ſeek after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they are but a few, and why ſhould you go from the way the multitude walks in? O poor Sinner, would you be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it is <hi>Chriſts</hi> own Doctrine, <hi>There be few that ſhall be ſaved;</hi> why ſhould then this be a ſtumbling block unto you? Have you a mind to go to Hell
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52041:58"/>for company? Many are the travellers that go hells beaten road, <hi>broad is the way that leads to deſtruction, and many there be that find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan prejudices many times young ones by the meanneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibleneſs of thoſe that are Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that know not the Law are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; few of the Rulers believed on him; not many wiſe Nobles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Poor receive the Goſpel. O poor Souls, know they are moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that are ſo in the account of God, and not of man.<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Since thou wert preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in my ſight, thou wert honourable: The Righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> They that honour God, God will honour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satan labours to fill Souls with prejudice againſt <hi>Christ,</hi> by preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the difficulties they ſhall meet withal. It is true, you may meet with diſcouragement in the way, but you ſhall have the breaker up go before you, and he will make the way eaſie, and crooked wayes ſtreight, and rough wayes ſhall become plain.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:52041:59"/>4. Satan labours to fill Souls with prejudice againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold infirmities that attend his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and indeed this is a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that all Seekers after <hi>Chriſt</hi> do not walk ſo cloſely as they ought. Well poor Soul, know, the wayes of God are the ſame, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the ſame, though it is ſad there ſhould be ſo much ground for this ſtumbling block lying in your way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Satan labours to fill them with prejudice againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from the Croſs that attends them; and the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been a Rock of offence to many poor Souls. Well but poor Soul, there is a Crown annexed to the Croſs, they that ſuffer with him ſhall raign with him. Unto you I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Kingdom; who were they? Such as continued with him in great temptations.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If morning Seekers be ſure and infallible finders, then it is a word of <hi>Caution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take heed of giving over, of being too ſhort breathed in ſeeking of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> He that believes makes not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52041:59"/>haſt. To ſet on this Caution which is of great concernment to every poor Soul that hath ſet out to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> although it was hinted the laſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I will enlarge it now.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you give over, your hearts were never truly in good earneſt in the work. It may be you had ſome flaſhes of affection, or ſome gripes and pangs of conviction, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtartled you, but yet your hearts were not truly in good earneſt in the work. Ah poor Soul, that truly ſees its need of <hi>Christ,</hi> the real worth and excellency that is in him, its real mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery without him, this Soul will never give over untill it hath found him, <hi>whom its Soul loveth.</hi> Is that love in good earneſt, that becauſe it meets diſcouragements, gives over the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the object? The Spouſe was in good earneſt, therefore gives not over, but ſtill keeps up her enquiries after <hi>Chriſt, Saw you him whom my Soul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If you give over you loſe the prize; if the racers give over they loſe;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.24.</note> therefore we have that Caution, <hi>So
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52041:60"/>run as you may obtain.</hi> Is not this ſad to be runners and loſers, ſeekers and miſſers at laſt? Poor Souls, if you give over you will go without; <hi>He that continues to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi> We are to run with patience the Race ſet before us; to run it, and not give over.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you give over, and ſo ſit down ſhort of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it will aggravate your guilt and condemnation. What, you that once were ſo forward in the ways of God; what, you that once gave ſuch good hopes you were truly in love with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> what, you that were once praying young men and women, and nigh the Kingdom, as that Scribe we read of in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 13.26.</note> and to give over? O how will this aggravate your miſcarriage! and you your ſelves ſhut out, this aggravates all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you give over ſeeking, you will fall either into perſecution or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs; uſually this is the end of ſuch. When young men, while they have been Apprentices, and under convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they have ſought <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52041:60"/>afterwards fall off again, they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prove, either Perſecutors of the wayes of God, or elſe Profane; this is in judgement upon them. God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to fall into theſe things, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſin with ſin; and very ſad hath been the end of ſuch. Would you ever think this hopeful praying young man would prove a drunkard, a ſwearer, a prodigal? If you give over ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this I doubt will be your end.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you give over ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this will be a great diſcouragement to others; you weaken the hands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they will be afraid when they ſee you ſo ſadly drawn back, that they ſhould do ſo too; you hinder others ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. If you give over ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you cloath your Miniſters with ſhame; and is this the love you have formerly profeſt to them? O how once you were endeared to thoſe ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! How could you have pulled out your very eyes for them, when they were firſt inſtrumental to do your ſouls good; and is this your kindneſs unto them, to put them unto ſhame?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52041:61"/>Diſappointments bring ſhame; <hi>Make me not aſhamed of my hope,</hi> ſayes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> O many Miniſters had hopes of you, and prayed for you, and have hoped you would be their <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) and what now prove their ſhame? O how near this will go to the hearts of Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters! Have not they ſaid of you, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of them, <hi>We live, if you ſtand faſt in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If morning Seekers be ſure and infallible finders, then take heed of a diſcouraged frame of heart in ſeeking <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this is Satans work, to diſcourage poor Souls, to lay ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks in their way, and tell them there is no hope, no; <hi>Chriſt</hi> will never be found of ſuch as they are, <hi>hope is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> O take heed I ſay of this frame of heart; you know what they ſaid to the poor blind man, <hi>Be of good cheer, the Lord calleth thee:</hi> So do I ſay unto you poor morning Seekers, be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, the Lord will be found of you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A diſcouraged frame of heart will open a door to hard thoughts of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52041:61"/>God. Uſually diſcouraged Souls are jealous and ſuſpicious Souls of God; and alas! this will weaken you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in your ſeeking after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O what a hard thought was that, <hi>My God hath forgotten, my God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A diſcouraged frame of heart grieves the Spirit of God; what, ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> with a diſcouraged frame of heart? can this be pleaſing to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, who is the Comforter?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A diſcouraged frame of heart opens a door to conſult with Satan, he loves to be fiſhing in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ordinarily he ſits by diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Souls, helping them to conclude againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and their own Souls; it is a very dangerous thing to be drawn in to conſult with Satan.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A diſcouraged frame of heart will weaken your endeavours in your purſuits after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the joy of the Lord is a believers ſtrength, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements weaken exceedingly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A diſcouraged frame of heart in ſeeking <hi>Christ,</hi> reflects upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as though he were unwilling to be found
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52041:62"/>of poor ſinners: This is diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> diſhonourable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of coming into the world; was it not to ſave Sinners? diſhonourable to his Promiſes; hath not he promiſed, <hi>He will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If morning Seekers ſhall be ſure and certain ſinders, then take heed of delaying to ſeek the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; do not put off <hi>Chriſt;</hi> take heed of this, becauſe that you are young, and hope you have time before you. O this many times is a Rock that ſplits thouſands of Souls; they ſay they will ſeek <hi>Christ</hi> at a more convenient time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of loſing your morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the preſent time is only yours. Alas poor Soul! if thou layeſt not hold of the fore-lock of thy preſent time, thou mayeſt be undone for ever. O how the Lord calls on us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our preſent time; Work while it is to day, and if you will hearken to his voice, while it is to day; walk in the light, while you have the light; now is the acceptable time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take heed of loſing your morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52041:62"/>You young ones, you know not how ſhort your morning may be; and when mornings are ſhort, perſons had need be up and doing. How many young ones have been cut off in their morning, in the prime of their time, in the flower of their youth, gone to the Grave in a moment, while the milk was in their breaſts, and marrow in their bones?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed you loſe not your morning; it will be harder work to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> afterwards, when you have delayed time after time: after you have loſt the forenoon of your lives, it will be hard redeeming the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. O how rare a thing is it to ſee a perſon wrought on in their after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon? not but ſome have been met with; but this is not ſo ordinary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more guilt there is upon the Soul, the harder it will be to ſeek out after <hi>Christ;</hi> the longer thou delayeſt, the more guilt thou contracteſt upon thy Soul. O what complaints have ſuch Souls uttered. O that I had come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſooner! but will he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to mercy, who have ſtood
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52041:63"/>out ſo long? Had I fallen in with <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon his firſt offers, and tenders, it had been more eaſie to have thought he would have accepted me. And thou wilt find this a ſtrong objection upon thee; the heavier load of guilt upon thy Soul, the heavier thou wilt find it to draw to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be harder for you to ſeek after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after you have delayed, becauſe the ſenſe of your unkindneſs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> will fill your Souls when you are awakened. What, ſtand out againſt <hi>Christ,</hi> after ſo many knocks, after ſo many calls, after ſo many offers, and invitations? Thus it was with the Spouſe when ſhe aroſe to open to her Beloved, there was a little myrrhe left upon the handles of the lock, and then her bowels were moved, <hi>(viz.)</hi> She was filled with ſhame and ſorrow that ſhe ſhould uſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo unkindly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more a Spirit of ſloth takes poſſeſſion on the Soul, the harder it is to ſhake off.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed of loſing your morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for a dark night is faſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon you, in which you cannot
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52041:63"/>ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which you cannot work; it is bad ſeeking any thing in the dark. I may ſay unto you as the Prophet to them, <hi>Give Glory to God before he cauſe darkneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 13.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and before your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountaion.</hi> This is the Doctrine that our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> preacht himſelf; <hi>Work while it is to day, for night comes when no man can work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Poor Souls, what if a night of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial darkneſs, and blindneſs come upon you? What if God give you over to a dark heart? He ſuffered ſome we read of to walk in the wayes of their own heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if a night of temptation come upon you? It is ill ſeeking <hi>Chriſt</hi> under temptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What if a night of death come upon thee, then thy ſeeking <hi>Chriſt</hi> is at end; there is no work in the grave where thou goeſt. What though young men, you be now in your morning, God can cauſe your Sun to ſet at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and bring a night upon you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are aware; therefore loſe not your morning.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52041:64"/>5. Take heed you loſe not your morning; your morning diſcoveries and manifeſtations will be your even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupports and conſolations; the evening of our lives is our declining time, our old age. And O what a mercy is this, to be laid in with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort when that comes! What a ſad thing is that, to ſee one gray-headed, and forſaken of God? As <hi>David</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many have cauſe to pray, <hi>forſake me not when I am gray-headed.</hi> If you ſeek him in your youth, he will ſit by you when you are old. O that is a ſad Text, <hi>and the ſinner an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed.</hi> O but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious Souls that have ſought him while they were young, that comfort themſelves with his loving kindneſs of old, that remember the ſweet love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and paſſages betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and their poor Soul, and at laſt go off the ſtage of this life triumphing. To ſee an old Chriſtian go comfortably to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, leaning over the ſtaff of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and telling of nothing but his youth experiences of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> O what a ſight is this! And on the other ſide,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52041:64"/>to ſee an old man, who hath nothing to remember, but what a drunken wretch he hath been, what a wicked company-keeper he hath been, what an unclean filthy wretch he hath been, what an oppreſſor of other men he hath been; and ſuch ſtories he can tell you all day: O what a dreadful thing is this!</p>
               <p n="6">6. Take heed you loſe not your morning; when God doth awaken you, and get you out of your bed of ſin and ſloth, it will grieve, and cut you to the very heart, that you got up no ſooner, that you have loſt ſo much time already. O how many Souls have been deeply wounded with the ſenſe of their loſt time? O what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have ſuch Souls groaned out, That I ſhould be ſo long in the ſervice of ſin and Satan, O that I ſhould ſpend ſo many years in gratifying the luſts of the fleſh, in making proviſion for the fleſh, and all that while put a ſlight upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth ſeeking.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Caution,</hi> If morning Seekers ſhall be ſure and certain finders of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:52041:65"/>then let them take heed of haſty and raſh concluding againſt <hi>Christ</hi> and their own Souls; this is an infirmity that young Seekers are mightily prone to in their firſt convictions. O ſure <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> will not be found of ſuch poor ſinful, vile Creatures as we are: we have been ſuch <hi>Ephraims,</hi> ſuch Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks unaccuſtomed to the yoke, ſuch Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> ſo ſtubborn even from our youth up, we cannot think he would be found of us, though we ſhould ſeek him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> O poor Soul, do you think <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not matter his word? If under your temptations you ſhould think he does not matter your Soul, yet think he matters his word. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you ſay, remember the Word, Lord, upon which thou cauſeſt me to hope. Do you think <hi>Christ</hi> is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whether his Promiſes be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed or no? No, no, not one Jota of his Promiſe ſhall fail. You may be diſcouraged, but the Promiſe is in reference to bruiſed reeds and ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax.<note place="margin">Ite. 42.4.</note> It is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, nor fail;</hi> you may, but he ſhall not.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:52041:65"/>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> why, Souls, ſhould you think he will not accept of you, are not your names in his Commiſſion? He was ſent to ſeek and ſave ſuch as are loſt; and are not you loſt Souls? Loſt in your ſelves, loſt prodigals. This my Son was loſt: and do you think he will not then accept of you?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> why think you ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> call ſuch? <hi>He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> Be of good chear poor Soul, the Lord calls on thee, as was ſaid to the poor blind man. But ſomething of this nature will fall in upon another uſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will forbear now.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Branch of the <hi>Caution;</hi> then let morning Seekers take heed they do not ſit down ſhort of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Why, if he will be found of us, ſhould we ſit down ſhort of him? As it is ſaid in that caſe, ſo may I ſay in this; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, let us not ſeem to reſt ſhort of it. There are many things morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are prone to reſt in on this ſide <hi>Christ.</hi> You may take up in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52041:66"/>convictions, in your conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional affections, in your acquired gifts and parts, in your reſtraining grace, in a form of profeſſion, and ſo miſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> take heed of reſting ſhort of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> many thouſands have done ſo. We read of the Scribe that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſcreetly, and Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art nigh unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God:</hi> But alas, he was ſhort of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for all this. And alſo the young man in the Goſpel reſted ſhort of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and alſo the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom we read of came ſhort of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> take heed morning Seekers you do not reſt ſhort of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this will aggravate your miſery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in miſſing of him. What, you that were within a little of <hi>Chriſt</hi> miſs him! What, you that were in ſo fair a way for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you who ſet out ſo hopefully in the morning of your day! O for poor Souls in Hell, to ſing ſuch doleful ditties, I was once convinced of my ſin, and I was once convinced of my miſery without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and I
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52041:66"/>was once convinced of the excellency of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> But O my corruptions were too ſtrong for my convictions! and ſo my poor Soul ſat ſhort of the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> To miſcarry within a little of harbour, within ſight of land; O what a cutting aggravation is this to poor Seamen, when almoſt at their Port? So many Souls have done, they have been almoſt perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, yet they have reſted ſhort of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> take heed, morning Seekers, that you reſt not ſhort of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Satan, if it be poſſible, will keep you ſhort of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> this is Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, if he can but perſwade the Soul to take up in ſomething on this ſide <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſome notion, ſome opinion. Hence it is, as ſoon as young people come under any convictions of ſin, and when any good Seed is ſowen in the Soul, then comes Satan with his Tares. Then they get, it may be, ſome notion or opinion whereby Satan does divert them, and hinder them from cloſing with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And when they are gotten hither, here they reſt.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52041:67"/>Thouſands have been eternally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done this way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo, that morning Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall be ſure and certain finders of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> then it is an <hi>

O poor Souls, do not you hear him Call? Call upon him while he is near, ſeek him while he is to be found. What, is not the Lord Jeſus worth ſeeking? he is then worth nothing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Motive</hi> to ſeek the Lord in your morning; now is your ſeeking time; ſeeking will not alwayes be in ſeaſon. You muſt do things in their proper ſeaſon; there is a time for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſe, now is the acceptable time, now is the day of Salvation.

               <p n="2">2. There is a day coming wherein the things that concern your peace will be hid from your eyes. Thus God told <hi>Jeruſalem, But now the things that concern your Peace are hid from your eyes.</hi> You will be judicially har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.</p>

               <p n="5">5. There is a day coming, that death and hell ſhall look ghaſtly upon you; and will this be a ſeeking time? Will not <hi>Chriſt</hi> tell you, O poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this is but a force? Now when you ſee no way but damuation before you, now you ſeek after me: this is only to ſerve your own ends of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O poor Souls, be perſwaded to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> before theſe dayes come upon you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Motive</hi> in the morning of your dayes to be ſeeking the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſuch Souls ſhall live; in him you may have life, life is only to be had in him, therefore he is called a Believers Life.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They that ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> have living Graces from him; <hi>we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his fulneſs, Grace for Grace;</hi> all we have muſt be in a way of ſeeking; not only Grace at the firſt effuſion, when he ſayes to the Soul <hi>live,</hi> but

What is the reaſon the blind Papiſts appoint ſo many Penances, ſo many Pilgrims, ſo many Faſts and Scourgings, but they hope theſe are expiatory?

               <p n="3">3. What if God towards the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy day take away from thee the advantages thou once had for thy poor Soul?

Under the notion of a leader, 2. Under the notion of a witneſs, 3.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52041:74"/>gives theſe poor Gentiles a Call, which is the words of my Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Text we have a Call, or Exhortation to a duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have a Motive or Argument backing that Call.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Call is, <hi>Seek the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Let us inquire a little, what is meant by this Call, <hi>Seek the Loed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is this implyed in it. This people and the Lord were ſtrangers. This is the deſcription of a Gentile; <hi>He is a ſtranger to the Lord,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus is willing to be found of poor Gentile Sinners. I muſt keep cloſe to my Text; and it ſpeaks of ſuch as have been before hinted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us make inquiry what a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Sinner is? In the general take this Anſwer.</p>
            <p>A Gentile Sinner is the worſt of Sinners; the vileſt of Sinners: thus the Apoſtle deſcribes them,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.15.</note> 
               <hi>We who are Jews by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles:</hi> They were reckoned the greateſt ſinners.<note place="margin">Mark 16.15.</note> 
               <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature (viz.)</hi> Gentiles, as though they were not worthy the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52041:75"/>name of men and women. That we may ſet off the Free Grace of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to poor Sinners, let us ſee a Scripture-map of Gentiliſm, or Gentile Sinners, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus willing to be found of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are ſaid to be Idolaters. <hi>Howbeit, then when ye knew not God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>ye did ſervice unto them,</hi> who were <hi>no Gods.</hi> While they were in Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, that is Gentiliſm; God is willing to be found of ſuch. What though you have been Idolaters? yet ſuch may have mercy from God.<note place="margin">Jer. 14.22.</note> In that black Catalogue of Sinners, Idolaters are reckoned among the <hi>Corinthians, ſuch were ſome of you.</hi> Idols are called the vanities of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gentiles were poor ſlaves.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>For we our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, &amp;c.</hi> They were ſervants to their luſts: their luſts did Lord it over them. <hi>Know you not you are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to him whom you obey?</hi> Yet of theſe poor Souls <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found. O do not ſay then, I am a poor Gentile, too great a Sinner ever
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52041:76"/>to find favour from the hands of God.<note place="margin">Luk. 15.15.</note> The prodigal Gentile was a ſlave joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Citizen to keep Swine, and yet God took him to be a Son; out of the field into the houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gentiles are poor hood-winkt blind Souls. <hi>Call in the blind and the halt; (viz.)</hi> the poor Gentiles now become the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſts</hi> gueſts, and the Jewes are rejected. <hi>The God of this world hath blinded</hi> their <hi>eyes:</hi> they go muffled in ignorance of God and <hi>Christ</hi> from day to day: yet God is willing to be found of them. They are ſuch muffled Creatures,<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> that they are ſaid to feel after God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Gentile is a poor periſhing Soul. The poor man that was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lay periſhing of his wounds, is the poor Gentile,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.30.</note> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> to, and binds up his wounds, and pours oyl into them. We may ſay we are all poor <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ready to periſh, and yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be found of ſuch.<note place="margin">Joh. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoever believes on him,</hi> Jew or Gentile, <hi>might not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Doth thy poor Soul ſay as the poor prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52041:76"/>did, <hi>and I periſh for hunger?</hi> O <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found of ſuch.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Gentile is a poor Soul that lies far from God. They are the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the far Countrey.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>You who were a far off, are brought nigh by the blood of Jeſus.</hi> He is there ſpeaking of Gentiles. They are ſaid by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to be <hi>far from Rightcouſneſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 46. ult.</note> Well poor Souls, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found of ſuch. Alas, Sir, ſayes a poor Soul, I am a great way from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> O ſo were Gentiles; there was a wall of partition betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and them; yet <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood took it away, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the ſtones in this partition wall.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A Gentile is a poor Soul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope. Without <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.12. Without hope of being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </note> without hope, can thou be worſe? Yet <hi>Christ</hi> is willing to be found of ſuch. Alas, ſayes a poor Soul, I have no hope. Thou art a Gentile, a poor hopeleſs Soul. Becauſe they are without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they are without hope. The Heathens feigned when all was gone, yet Hope was in the bottom of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>'s box, implying that Hope is a good refuge in calamity.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:52041:77"/>7. A Gentile is one that is a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer of the name of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom 2.24.</hi> Chriſtiani ſanctè vix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſent, ſi Chriſtus ſancta do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiſſet.</note> 
               <hi>For the name of God is blaſphemed through you.</hi> They did take all occaſions to ſpeak evil of God, for the infirmities of his followers. <hi>If Chriſt had taught them better, they would have lived better,</hi> was the brand of Gentiles, caſt upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he was a Blaſphemer, and yet obtained mercy. It is the ſpirit of a Gentile to ſpeak evil of his Name, becauſe of the miſcarriages of his followers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Gentile is one that ſeeks only after earthly things. An earthly ſpirit is the ſpirit of the Gentiles. <hi>After theſe things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6.32.</note> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>do the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſeek.</hi> It may be many poor Souls have made the comfort of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their <hi>Summum Bonum;</hi> never ſought after any thing for their Souls in all their lives: Yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls ſuch to ſeek him; yea is willing to be found of ſuch. What though thou haſt been a poor earth-worm all thy dayes? yet if now thou ſeek the Lord, there is hope for thee; if thy heart be in good earneſt for Heaven.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:52041:77"/>
            <p>Take theſe Scriptural deſcriptions of Gentiles, to ſet off the Free grace of God to the worſt of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be found of poor <hi>Gentile</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this was the end of the Fathers donations; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the great gift of his Father. Now ſurely the Lord would never have parted with ſuch a gift as his own Son, but he had ſome great end in ſuch a gift. Well, what was the Fathers deſign? <hi>He gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in him might not periſh but have eternal life:</hi> That <hi>Gentile</hi> ſinners might not periſh to all eternity.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.18.</note> Therefore we read of ſuch Souls being <hi>made nigh by the blood of Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>through him we have both Acceſs, (viz.)</hi> both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>to the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Many poor Souls are under Objections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the willingneſs of God to ſhew them mercy. Do you think that the Lord would have parted with his own Son for you, if he had not been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew you mercy? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tells us,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.6.</note> 
               <hi>He is given for a Covenant
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52041:78"/>to the people, for a light to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be found of poor <hi>Gentile</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, this is evident from the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he gives them to come in to him. O what an invitation is this very Call of my Text to ſuch? O how do the affections of <hi>Christ</hi> ſparkle in his invitations? 1. Conſider his invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are free: There is no merit on our ſide, there is no ſuch thing, as worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Creature. <hi>Chriſt</hi> moves freely from Arguments ſpringing up in his own bowels; My Creature will be loſt elſe, this poor Soul will be undone for ever elſe: And as <hi>Heſter</hi> ſaid in that caſe, ſo ſayes <hi>Chriſt, How can my heart endure to ſee this evil come upon my people and kindred?</hi> So, O ſayes <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> how can my heart endure to let this poor Soul go to Hell, and eternally periſh? And thus his heart works freely in his invitations towards poor Sinners. 2. His invitations are affectionate invitations: invitations mixed with entreaties. <hi>I beſeech you be reconciled unto God.</hi> Chriſt doth not only invite, but becomes a ſuppliant
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52041:78"/>to the ſinner. He comes to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is obſtinate and inexorable, and upon his knees begs the Soul for his ſake, for its own ſake, to accept of terms of mercy and reconciliation. 3. They are importunate invitations. He doth not invite with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Spirit, whether we accept of his terms or no, but he invites in good earneſt, and ſets on invitations with preſſing arguments, ſometimes taking an argument from the Souls danger, if it cloſe not with his invitations, ſometimes an argument from the Souls duty, and ſometimes an argument from the Souls benefit and profit; theſe are importunate invitations. 4. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations are daily and inceſſant invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Poor Sinners are daily invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an every dayes Solicitor and Suitor; he waits to be gracious: If you deny him to day, he comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to morrow; he doth not caſt off for every preſent denyal. 5. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations are univerſal; therefore thou mayſt ſay as he did, <hi>I am invited alſo.</hi> O poor Sinner, God hath not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee if thy unbelief exclude thee
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52041:79"/>not. 6. His invitations are upon the moſt ſolemn preparations that ever was: <hi>All things are ready.</hi> Hath he invited and prepared his gueſts, and doth not this argue his willingneſs to entertain?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found of Gentile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, becauſe upon this account the Father enters into a Covenant with the Son to reward him. There was a Covenant ſtruck betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Father, that upon his undertaking the great work of Mans Redemption, he would exalt him and glorifie him. <hi>I will glorifie thee.</hi> The Rewards of <hi>Christ</hi> for Redemption-work ſeem to conſiſt in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The converſion of Souls.<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.6.</note> 
               <hi>Is it a ſmall thing thou raiſe the Tribes of Iſrael? I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles:</hi> as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſtand with his Father and ſay, But Lord what will become of the poor Gentile part of the world? Muſt they all dye in their ſins and be damned? O the heart of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was inflamed with love after the ſalvation of poor
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52041:79"/>Sinners. Well, now the Lord gives him a Patent for Gentiles as well as Jews; a Patent of Free Grace:<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note> this is covenanted for, betwixt God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son: this is the promiſe of Eternal Life before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. <hi>He ſhall ſee the travil of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His exaltation is promiſed. So he ſhall ſprinkle nations, <hi>(viz.)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them: Sprinkle them with his blood: an alluſion to the blood of the Paſchal Lamb, when the deſtroyer was to paſs over.<note place="margin">Iſa. 52.15.</note> 
               <hi>And Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him:</hi> Shall all be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at the ſetting up of his Dominion; they ſhall be convinced of his Kingly Office and Dignity: Not a word to ſay againſt the Lord Jeſus as King.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53 ult. He ſhall conquer them, and deliver the Elect out of their hands.</note> Therefore ſayes another Text, <hi>He ſhall divide a portion with the great:</hi> Some read it, <hi>I will give him a portion among the great:</hi> He ſhall have his day of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible greatneſs among them. Others read it, <hi>He ſhall divide the Mighty as a prey:</hi> This will be <hi>Chriſts</hi> work when he comes forth in Majeſty, to prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that ſtand in his way to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52041:80"/>whether perſons or things. Now this clearly demonſtrates the point in hand; becauſe God Covenants for this with him upon his undertaking Redemption and Salvation-work.</p>

               <p>Is it ſo, that the Lord Jeſus is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be found of Gentile Sinners? Then,</p>

I have ſpread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, (viz.)</hi> to a company of poor obſtinate Jews, <hi>and lo therefore I turn to the Gentiles.</hi> Behold, here I am, here I am; ſo ſome read it, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> holding out terms of Mercy, Life and Salvation to poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. If a man find his Enemy, ſayes <hi>Saul,</hi> will he let him go well away? O the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Gentiles which were enemies!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is there not love in this, to call theſe firſt to look after him? Is not this preventing love? <hi>Did I look after him,</hi> ſaid poor <hi>Hagar, who here ſees me?</hi> Alas, if the Lord had never found me out, I had never found him. He is called a Shepherd that ſeeks out his Sheep. O here do we run into corners
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52041:81"/>from this good Shepherd, untill he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us! O what love is this!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is there not love in this, to tell us there is a time coming when it will be too late to ſeek him? See how free and ingenuous, as I may ſay, Divine Love is; it tells us the worſt, that we might be awakened to look about us. If you neglect but a while, follow your ſins for a while, ſet out your day of Grace for a while, then it will be over, and the bowels of the Lord will be ſhut up in diſpleaſure againſt you; and then you will ſay, as he upon his death-bed, <hi>I have told you, now all is too late, all is now too late.</hi> Is there not great love in warning Souls of danger before it comes?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is there not love in this, that the Rejection of the Jews, the Cutting off them ſhould be the grafting in of the Gentiles? O that ſuch wild Olives ſhould be partakers of the ſweetneſs of the fat Olive! that ever ſuch bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſhould be inoculated into <hi>Chriſt!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> This raiſed up the ſpirit of <hi>Paul</hi> into a frame of admiration. The caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Jews, was the reconciling of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:52041:81"/>5. There is love in this, that <hi>Christ</hi> was ſo willing to come as his Fathers Gift, as a Commander and Leader to his People, as the words before ſpeak. See how <hi>Chriſts</hi> heart ecchoes to the heart of the Father in the work of the Salvation of poor Sinners! <hi>In the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of thy Book it is written, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> O then let us a little admire the condeſcention of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this thing, that he is ſo willing to be found of poor Gentiles. It is no wonder, if upon the head of this Divine Miſtery be written a <hi>verily, Verily he took upon him not the nature of Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>but the Seed of Abraham.</hi> That he ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook them Glorious Creatures; that Mercy ſhould come to poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles over the head of Angels; how few take notice of this?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to look into theſe deeps; and yet we do not look into them with an eye of holy inſpection and heavenly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another word is this, If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be willing to be found of poor Gentile Sinners, it is then a Call to ſuch to ſeek
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52041:82"/>him. <hi>Seek him while he may be found.</hi> May not I ſay to poor Sinners, as God argues the caſe with thoſe Jews by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Why will ye dye O ye houſe of Iſrael?</hi> So, why do poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Sinners neglect ſeeking the Lord Jeſus? Is not this to go careleſly the ready way to your Eternal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is not this the rode to your Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ruine? And will not the Lord ſay to you one day, as the Prophet to them, <hi>Your deſtruction is of your ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Motive</hi> to ſeek the Lord. He firſt is ſuitor to you, and ſeeks you; And is not this a mighty motive? This is that great loadſtone that ſhould draw the hearts of poor Sinners much in love with <hi>Christ:</hi> He loves them firſt: <hi>Who loved us firſt. Chriſt</hi> is firſt in the motion. <hi>He came to ſeek and to ſave that which is lost.</hi> Take that Parable of the Prodigal, his Father ſent after him into the far Country, ſought him out, <hi>This my Son was loſt, and is found.</hi> Nay, <hi>Christ</hi> is the Shepherd of the Gentiles, and he ſeeks out his ſheep in a dark and gloomy day. Alas, what is the Goſpel but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſending after
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52041:82"/>poor Sinners to wooe them, to accept of terms of Grace and Mercy?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Motive</hi> to ſeek the Lord Jeſus. His ſeeking you coſt him dear. He laid down his life for his ſheep. He ſought you, and where did he find you? He found you ſlaves, and he muſt pay your ranſome for you. <hi>I have found a ranſome for him.</hi> His death is our ranſome. We were priſoners and captives, and could not be redeemed at a lower rate than <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Motive.</hi> He comes from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeek you. The verſes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are a Prophecy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Father. <hi>I have given him for a witneſs.</hi> And frequently when he is ſpoken of to poor Gentile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then he is ſaid to come by way of donation. <hi>I have given him a light to the Gentiles.</hi> He comes and brings commendations of his Fathers love to poor Sinners. He is called the <hi>faithful and true witneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Motive.</hi> He came from Heaven to ſeek you. O what Glory he left to come and mind your Eternal concerns upon earth! I cannot, nay, what Man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52041:83"/>or Angel can tell you what he forſook to ſeek you? He ſtript himſelf of all his Glory, of all his Royal Robes, to waſh your feet, to waſh you all over. He left his Throne. I remember it is ſtoried of a King, that found a ſheep in a ditch, and ſate down on hands and knees, and pulled it out with his own hands. The Sheep is thy own Soul, this King is the Lord Jeſus, the Ditch is thy Natural Condition in which thou hadſt periſhed to all Eternity, if he had not come from Heaven to have pull'd thee out.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Motive.</hi> He ſeeks as impatient of denyal. He is an importunate Seeker, he will not be ſaid nay; ſeeks like a beggar that will not be gone from your doors. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be gone from the door of thy heart, he ſtands and knocks; he doth not knock as he paſſes by, but ſtands waiting for thy coming out to accept of him, and cloſe with him; Therefore he beſeeches, wooes, waits to be Gracious. He comes in Ordinance after Ordinance, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence after Providence, Motion after Motion, and Day after Day: What
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52041:83"/>ſayeſt thou poor Soul, wilt thou now cloſe with me? And as he did, <hi>Wilt thou be made whole,</hi> to the Leper? And O how loth to go away! when will it once be?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Motive.</hi> He is a Seeker that is grieved when he is denyed. <hi>He was grieved becauſe of their unbelief, and the hardneſs of their hearts.</hi> You cannot grieve <hi>Chriſt</hi> worſe than deny him, when he comes to make out love to your Souls, and you ſlight him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Motive.</hi> He ſeeks poor Sinners in their proper months.<note place="margin">Jer. 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>In their months one ſhall find them: Chriſt</hi> knows the months to find Sinners in. All theſe <hi>Motives</hi> are taken from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the great ſeeker of Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is of Reproof, 1. to ſuch as neglect to ſeek the Lord, that ſeek him not at all. Yet they are Seekers, but not Seekers of the Lord. Gentiles are Seekers, <hi>after theſe things the Gentiles ſeek.</hi> They ſeek good trading, good livelihoods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alas, this is all they ſeek after. Nay,<note place="margin">Lev. 10.31.20.6.</note> we read of ſome that <hi>ſeek after Wizards,</hi> they are ſo far from ſeeking after God. But the Lord
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52041:84"/>ſayes, he will ſet his face againſt ſuch. Do you think, poor Seamen, and you their wives, that this is the way to have good voyages, to go to ask the Devil his Counſel? Some ſeek their luſts,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.30.</note> like <hi>Solomons</hi> drunkard they ſay, they <hi>will ſeek it yet again.</hi> But all this while they ſeek not the Lord. O how few ſeek to the Lord? What are theſe poor Souls ſeeking, but the living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead?</p>
               <p n="1">1. See the danger of ſuch as ſeek not the Lord. Such poor Souls ſee no worth in the Lord; and are not ſuch to be reproved? If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not worth ſeeking, he is worth nothing. When we ſee the worth of any thing, we will ſeek after it. The object we ſeek, muſt be ſome good. O how neglecters to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> do undervalue <hi>Chriſt!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They never ſee a want of him. We ſeek not, that we want not. O but now when the poor Soul doth ſee its need of him, then it doth with the Spouſe ſeek him. Poor Gentiles, they ſit ſtill. It is the Character of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to ſit in darkneſs, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you who ſat in darkneſs a great light ſhined, (viz.)</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52041:84"/>to Gentiles. They have no mind to riſe off from their ſeat.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will aggravate the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſought them, and they would not be found of him. <hi>How often would I have gathered thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are a company of poor ſouls that object, what have we to do with <hi>Christ,</hi> ſuch poor Sinners as we are?</p>
               <p>O poor Souls, the great Promiſe is to ſuch; <hi>To it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 11.10.</note> All poor Sinners muſt betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Glorious Enſign. <hi>The root of Jeſſe ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the people, to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we are dark Creatures?<note place="margin">Luk. 1.79.</note> 
                  <hi>He came to give light to them that ſate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and guide our feet in the wayes of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is of Inquiry, If <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſo willing to be found of Gentile Sinners, what then may be the reaſons why poor Sinners do not ſeek the Lord Jeſus? O how few Seekers hath the Lord Jeſus! Sinners, it is true, are Seekers, but it is of the living among the dead.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:52041:85"/>1. Poor Sinners ignorance of the worth of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> who will or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after an unknown good? As he ſaid to the woman, <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13.44, 45, 46.</note> 
                  <hi>thou would ask living water, and he would give it thee:</hi> So do I ſay, If Souls knew the worth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they would cry, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi> Nothing without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below <hi>Christ,</hi> would ſatisfie their Souls. The Merchant man could not be ſatisfied with goodly Pearls, after he had come to know there was a Pearl of Price; then all the goodly Pearls were out-ſhined by the Pearl of great Price, and now he is reſolved upon any terms to have <hi>Chriſt. He ſells all.</hi> O what difference betwixt this perſon and the young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, who when <hi>Chriſt</hi> bid him <hi>ſell all,</hi> went away ſorrowful? O this broke the bargain betwixt him and <hi>Chriſt:</hi> He knew not the worth of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It may be <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not much valued by you now, but ask your hearts the queſtion, O my Soul, what will <hi>Chriſt</hi> be worth upon a death-bed? What will <hi>Chriſt</hi> be worth when thy Soul is filled with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52041:85"/>horrour of thy own guilt? When thou art a <hi>Magor Miſabib</hi> to thy ſelf? Nay, it may be to all that are round about thee? When thy heart is made to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate terrour? Could thou ask the damned in Hell what <hi>Chriſt</hi> would be worth to them, what they would give, if it could be procured, for one offer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in good earneſt? It may be they might better inform thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If you did converſe with awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened dying guilty conſciences, or with poor damned Souls, they might tell you ſomething of the worth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or with Souls deeply groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under guilt at firſt Converſion, or with poor tempted Souls: Theſe four ſorts of perſons can tell you what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions they have of the worth of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> When men know the worth of a commodity, it will go hard but they will obtain it. O what will a Malefactor judge a Pardon worth! So doth a poor ſelf-condemned Sinner judge of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Poor Sinners ſeek not after the Lord, becauſe they are lockt up under infidelity and unbelief. We read of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52041:86"/>being <hi>concluded and ſhut up under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> as cloſe priſoners under lock and key <hi>(in arctâ cuſtodiâ)</hi> they are in Satans cloſe cuſtody.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Poor Sinners believe not <hi>Chriſts</hi> willingneſs to embrace and entertain their poor Souls upon cloſure with him. Untill poor Sinners be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this, they can never make out after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it is we read of <hi>Chriſts</hi> invitations, and aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, entreaties, promiſes; all to demonſtrate his willingneſs to be found of ſinners, when they ſeek him. Alas, poor ſinners take up falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they think his heart is hardned againſt them, and his bowels ſhut up in diſpleaſure, and they take him for their adverſary, and all this is their unbelief; and ſo are hindred from looking out after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Poor Sinners believe not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers willingneſs to ſhew them mercy. Many Souls ſtick here, though <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath told them, he hath declared his Fathers Name, and would declare it to poor ſinners. O what pains doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> take to convince of his Fathers
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52041:86"/>good will!<note place="margin">Joh. 6.37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Poor Sinners believe not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible neceſſity to cloſe with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They do not ſee their Souls loſt for ever without a <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this brings me to the next particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Poor Sinners ſeek not after the Lord Jeſus, becauſe they are not throughly convinced of their miſery without <hi>Chriſt. Peter</hi> did not cry out, <hi>Maſter ſave me or I periſh,</hi> until he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſink: So poor Souls cry not after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeek not after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> until they ſee themſelves in a periſhing ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition. Perſons may fall under ſome convictions of their miſery, but alas, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lighty convictions, and ſo wear off the next temptation that comes upon their Soul: But when the conviction gets to the heart, then it is hopeful. When they were <hi>prickt to the heart,</hi> then they cryed out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> There are many convictions that get no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the head. But now when a ſenſe of miſery is clapt to a mans heart, it will make him look out after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52041:87"/>Let me ſhew poor Sinners ſomething of their miſery without <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. You are without hope; and is not this the height of miſery? Hope doth yield the Soul ſome relief in the ſaddeſt condition; but to be without hope, is to be in Hell above ground. What is it that makes Hell, Hell? they have no hope of ever coming forth, from the pit there is no redemption. If a man be in <hi>Algier,</hi> hope keeps up his heart, that he ſhall be redeemed one day: But there is not one priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hope in all hell among all the damned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Without <hi>Chriſt</hi> you are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men already. <hi>There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Then it follows, they that are out of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> are under the ſentence of condemnation. What a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth a poor condemned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture think himſelf to be in, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt night nor day but thinking of his execution? This is the caſe of a poor Soul out of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> though the Soul be not convinced of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The miſery of a Soul out of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52041:87"/>is in this, it is eternal miſery. The eternity of the miſery is the ſting of Hell, and the very emphaſis of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To be miſerable a thouſand years, and then to come out of it, the very thoughts of a better eſtate would be ſome kind of eaſe to the oppreſſed mind: but their miſery is like to be endleſs; and this compleats the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is called <hi>everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.8.</note> This brings me orderly to the next head.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Poor Sinners ſeek not out to the Lord Jeſus, becauſe they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced throughly of a future ſtate of the Soul. They are not under the powerful ſenſe of the Souls immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Who will ſeek out to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if they be not convinced that the Soul is an immortal being? <hi>Chriſts</hi> errand from Heaven to Earth is in vain, his whole ſeries of ſuffering is in vain, his whole undertaking of the work of mans redemption in vain, if there be no future ſtate of the Soul: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we live in a time and day that Atheiſm doth abound, let me offer by way of conviction ſome few Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52041:88"/>to prove the future ſtate of the Soul. Alas, men look not out after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they are not taken up with Eternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Argument is taken from <hi>Chriſts</hi> death,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.10.</note> which was to <hi>deliver from wrath to come.</hi> Then there is ſuch a thing as wrath to come, which could not be if there were no future ſtate of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Argument of a future ſtate is from the horrour that wicked men feel ſometimes in their conſciences, when they are awakened. O what <hi>Magor Miſabibs</hi> are they to themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times! Crying out, Wo is them that ever they were born, to ſin ſuch wrath upon their own heads. Theſe are the ſparks of Hell that are gotten into the Conſcience in this life, this is the gnawing of that worm that never dyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Argument is taken from the wiſhes of the wicked that they might dye the death of the Righteous, as <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Argument is taken from the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Saints. <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52041:88"/>his own ſoul?</hi> which is brought in to the Diſciples to caution them againſt Apoſtaſie. O, ſay poor believers, we may loſe our Souls, and therefore we may not apoſtatize from God, and therefore they will ſuffer the loſs of all. The poor people of God make a ſad bargain of it, if they ſuffer, and yet there ſhould be no reward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Argument is taken from the great deſires that ſometimes Believers have to be diſſolved, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; which, if there were no enjoyment of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would greatly be to believers loſs, becauſe they enjoy ſomething of God here.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Argument is taken from the great joy that many Saints have had in their paſſage into another world. How have they gone off the ſtage of this preſent life with triumph, and died boaſting and glorying in God?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Argument is taken from Saints Communion with God. If there be ſuch a thing here, then much more hereafter; what we enjoy here is but a drop to the Ocean.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Argument is taken from mens
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52041:89"/>natural unwillingneſs to dye. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there ſome thing follows death, that the Soul cannot endure to think on. It is true, the diſſolving of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-knot betwixt ſuch two dear lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as Soul and Body, is tedious to think of, yet there is ſome preappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of eternity, that trouble the Soul, that it cannot think of death with any quiet or comfort.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Argument is taken from the end of <hi>Christs</hi> appointments. God hath appointed the means of Grace in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſalvation of poor Souls. <hi>That thou may ſave thy own Soul, and them that hear thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Argument from the endeavours of Satan, <hi>ſeeking whom he may devour</hi> (or drink up, as the word is.) Satan would ſpare his pains, if there were no future ſtate of the Soul. Now it is no wonder if poor ſinners ſeek not the Lord Jeſus, when they lay not their ſouls under the convictions of the ſtate of the Soul after death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Poor Sinners ſeek not after the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by their worldly enjoyments
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52041:89"/>and employments. We read of ſome that made excuſes, and all their excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were from their worldly buſineſs, they could not come. I have obſerved that young perſons who have been under ſome notable convictions, and reſolutions to cloſe with <hi>Christ,</hi> and ſeek after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if ever they have aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cooled in their firſt love, it hath been when they have entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, changed their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſet up for themſelves; the world hath ſtoln their hearts from God. O how ſad is this! The world broke the bargain betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the young man in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>O but ſayes a poor Soul, I know not how to ſeek <hi>Chriſt:</hi> I am a poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Sinner that have ſate in darkneſs, and am in my dark ſtate of Gentiliſm to this day, and how ſhall I ſeek the Lord Jeſus that is, you ſay, thus wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be found of me?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seek the Lord betimes. If you would be ſpeeding Seekers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 8.5.</note> you muſt not be loyterers; there is but in time and out of time. Make no delay therefore, poor ſinner, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52041:90"/>the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time by the fore-lock. While it is to day, hearken to his voice: Now acquaint your ſelves with God. We muſt take hold of the preſent time. <hi>They that ſeek me early ſhall find me;</hi> (ſhall <hi>morning</hi> me, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is.) We muſt in our ſeeking give the morning to God. It is obſervable, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jacob</hi> got the bleſſing; in the morning the Lord looked through the cloud, and diſcomfited the Aegyptian Hoſt: Nay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is called <hi>the Hinde of the morning, the morning-ſtar;</hi> and all to teach us to ſeek him in the morning. The firſt fruits were to be dedicated to the Lord; the firſtling of every Creature was to be offered up in Sacrifice to the Lord: but the firſtling of an Aſs being ſo dull a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God would not accept it in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhould ſeek the Lord early, becauſe the preſent time is the only time to ſeek the Lord in. Now is the acceptable time. now is the day of ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon this monoſylable <hi>Now</hi> depends Eternity (ſayes one.)
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52041:90"/>There is a preſent time, and a preſent Truth for us to lay hold on. It was a good ſaying of him when invited to dinner to morrow, ſayes he, <hi>I have not promiſed myſelf a [to morrow] this many years. Who knows,</hi> ſayes <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, what to morrow may bring forth?</hi> What is in the womb of to morrow? What if thy death, nay, thy damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be in the womb of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day? We read of death and what was at the heels of death? and Hell immediately followed him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seek the Lord early; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promiſe your ſelves any more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Grace. If God ſhould prolong your lives, your day of Grace may have its ſun-ſet on a ſudden; and alas, what good will your lives do you, when you are wrapt up in groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? May not you ſay already, Woe unto us our day goeth away! Alas, there is a night coming when no man can work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seek the Lord early; If you have your lives lengthened, your means of Grace continued, yet you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe your ſelves any more gales of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52041:91"/>Spirit of God to breath upon you. And alas, what will Goſpel Ordinances ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to you, without the ſpirits influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences breathing in them? What is the moſt precious Miniſtry you can ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if not influenced from the Lord, by the efficacy of his own Spirit?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seek the Lord early; you have loytered long, you have ſlept much of your day of Grace away alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>He that ſleeps in harveſt is a Son that cauſeth ſhame; but he that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth in ſummer is a wiſe Son.</hi> O what a harveſt of the Goſpel have we ſlept in! O what a ſpirit of deep ſleep and ſlumber hath fallen upon us! O that we may all take that counſel, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p and be doing, and the Lord will be with you.</hi> Up and be ſeeking <hi>Chriſt</hi> early.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The longer you neglect to ſeek the Lord Jeſus, the more difficult it will be for you. Your very ſloth will take away your hearts: the more a man ſits ſtill, the leſs mind he hath to ſtir. Sitting is a pleaſing poſture; it is the deſcription of Gentile Sinners, <hi>they ſit in darkneſs;</hi> they are pleaſed with their dark ſtate: And it is hard
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52041:91"/>when we have indulged our ſloth, to ſtir up our ſelves to lay hold of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seek the Lord earneſtly as well as early. It is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he prayed earneſtly, when in his agony; and we read of ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate. Strive to an agony; put your Souls into an agony: So we muſt ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> having our Souls in an agony. Poor Souls, it may be, fall under ſome general convictions of their ſins, and they are now put upon ſeeking the Lord; but alas, it is with a kind of indifferency of ſpirit, as though they cared not whether they found him or not. We ſhould ſeek the Lord with <hi>Jacobs</hi> reſolution; <hi>I will not let thee go except thou bleſs me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cant. 1.2, 3, 4.</note> The Spouſe by night ſought <hi>Chriſt:</hi> in a night of perſecution (ſome refer it to that night of perſecution by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi>) yet ſhe gives not over ſeeking; but did ſhe find him? No, ſhe found him not. Now ſhe might have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome temptation to give over, <hi>why ſhould I wait upon the Lord any longer?</hi> O no, but ſhe falls now upon an earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſearch and enquiry after him, and now ſhe finds him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:52041:92"/>3. Seek the Lord under the ſenſe of a promiſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> believingly. They that ſeek ſhall find. If we have not our practice bottomed in our ſeeking of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon ſome promiſe, we ſhall have no comfort in it. But now when the Soul ſayes, I will go a ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but I will carry a promiſe with me; O this is very comfortable! <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſhall the Gentiles ſeek;</hi> and, <hi>in him ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> This is the Great <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of the Gentiles; thou muſt not ſeek to thy own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. We read of ſeeking that way.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.2.</note> You muſt not truſt in your ſelves, but <hi>in his Name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> If you know not where to truſt, come hither,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.18.</note> and here place your truſt. Many Souls ſeek <hi>Christ,</hi> but their eye of faith is not up to the promiſe in their ſeeking of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are to ſeek the Lord in a through ſenſe of our loſt condition without him. Many Souls ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but they do it not in a ſenſe of their undone condition. It is the loſt Soul that is the right ſeeker of <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> ſeeks ſuch Souls, and ſuch Souls ſeek
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52041:92"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt;</hi> then they are like to meet. That which is promiſed of the Jews Return holds good here;<note place="margin">Jer. 50.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Going and weeping, ſeeking the Lord their God, &amp;c.</hi> It will make you ſeek him weeping, if you were but convinced, you were loſt to all Eternity, undone for ever, irrecoverably miſerable, if you find not <hi>Christ.</hi> The firſt-ſtep to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is to be convinced of ones loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O now the Soul falls inquiring after <hi>Chriſt; If you ſee him whom my Soul loves, tell him, I am ſick of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Seek <hi>Chriſt</hi> perſeveringly. Thus the Spouſe did ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> untill ſhe found him; as the woman ſought her loſt groat until ſhe found it. The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſmote the Spouſe, and took away her veil from her, yet ſhe gives not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeeking her beloved. The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, either the Miniſterial watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or the Magiſterial, upon the City walls, they took away her veil <hi>(viz.)</hi> a token of ſubjection to <hi>Christ;</hi> yet ſhe perſeveres ſtill ſeeking <hi>Chriſt. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> wreſtled until the break of day: He was a perſevering wreſtler, and then came the bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:52041:93"/>6. We muſt ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> as appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father to entertain poor Gentile Sinners. Therefore we ſee the Commiſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to carry it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly towards poor Gentiles, ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flaxes, and bruiſed reeds. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put this work upon him, to treat with poor Gentiles about their everlaſting Salvation: and therefore we muſt ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſtinctly, under a diſtinct notion, as the Father hath commiſſioned him. Poor Sinners get ſome confuſed notions and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and upon theſe notions they ſeek <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but all this while they are ignorant of <hi>Chriſts</hi> being ſent as the Fathers Commiſſioner to treat with poor Sinners about the things that concern their peace. Several <hi>words</hi> the Spirit of God hath beſtowed upon this thing, noting to us that it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch great concernment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath ſet him forth to be a propitiation,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> or fore-ordained him to this end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath choſen him, <hi>My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom I have choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath called him.<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.6.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:52041:93"/>4. God hath anointed him to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God hath ſent him; now we ſhould conſider all theſe, and ſeek him as one thus ſent by his Father to treat with poor Sinners.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We muſt ſeek whole <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all his Offices. <hi>As you have received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo walk you in him.</hi> This is whole <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as Prophet, Prieſt, and Lord. And thus ſhould poor Gentile Sinners ſeek the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Obſervation</hi> is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there are eſpecial times for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to find the Lord Jeſus Christ in.</hi> Seek the Lord while he may be found.</p>
               <p>We read <hi>David</hi> pointing out ſuch a time, <hi>For this ſhall every one that is Godly pray unto thee in a time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.6.</note> 
                  <hi>when thou wilt be found:</hi> or, <hi>in a finding time</hi> (ſo we ſhould read it;) Others read it <hi>in a time of hitting,</hi> when Gods judgements go abroad, and the Lord hits the conſciences. But <hi>David</hi> had been confeſſing his ſins, and the Lord forgives him, and the ſenſe of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52041:94"/>raiſes his heart ſo, that he breaks out thus, the Godly ſhall pray unto thee in ſuch a time, in an eſpecial time.<note place="margin">Luk. 19.41, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>O Jeruſalem hadſt thou known in this thy day!</hi> It was an eſpecial time in which they might have found the Lord, he ſo ſweetly offering himſelf to them in the Goſpel. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Eccl. 8.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſcerneth time and judgment; becauſe to every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is a time and judgment; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſery of man is great upon him.</hi> So in this caſe, there is a time, an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial time to put your Spiritual purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into execution, to ſeek the Lord Jeſus in: Therefore that was good Counſel,<note place="margin">Job 22.20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Now acquaint thy ſelf with God, and be at peace, and thereby good ſhall come upon thee.</hi> Now ſeek the Lord. There are ſome eſpecial <hi>Nows</hi> that we ſhould all improve and lay hold on.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Now is the acceptable time, now is the day of ſalvation, &amp;c. I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thee, and ſaw thee in thy blood, and then it was a time of love, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great queſtion will be, what are theſe eſpecial times, in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:52041:94"/>1. When he offers himſelf in the tenders of the Goſpel. <hi>O Jeruſalem, hadſt thou known in this thy day.</hi> It was a peculiar time in which the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was preached to them. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found of you. What is the Goſpel but <hi>Christ</hi> ſeeking out his Sheep, his voice calling in his Sheep; <hi>Christ</hi> following poor ſinners with invitations and entreaties, that they would return unto him and live? We read of the Shepherd ſeeking out his ſheep. Would <hi>Christ</hi> offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that it is an eſpecial time of love? O poor Souls, take heed as you reject theſe offers. 1. Theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are a fruit of his blood; if he had not died, he never had been tendred to you; and for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe theſe offers, is for you to reject his purchaſe, nay, for you to tread his blood under-foot, and account the blood of the Covenant an unclean thing. And O how muſt this needs provoke the Lord, as is ſaid in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Supper, when they all had refuſed, the Lord was angry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that none of them ſhould taſte
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52041:95"/>of his Supper. 2. Theſe offers are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of life and ſalvation; O then take heed of rejecting them. <hi>You will not come to me that you may have life.</hi> Now is an eſpecial time, you may have life. If a poor condemned Malefactor ſhould but have his life offered him, O how would he be tranſported with joy! And this is the caſe of every poor ſinner out of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he is under a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation, and <hi>Christ</hi> comes and offers them their lives. O then as we value the lives of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls, let us not reject the offers of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. The offers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are unasked, unſought for by us, therefore it is now an eſpecial finding time. Thou poor ſinner doſt not come forth and ask a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and cry for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and lament after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O no, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> came out to offer himſelf to thy poor Soul, when thou lay dying and periſhing in thy blood, then he ſaid unto thee unasked, Live. 4. The offers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are not only of his Grace but of himſelf: He offers not only what he hath, but what he is, to thy Soul. <hi>But my people would have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52041:95"/>none of me. He that hath the Son, hath life.</hi> There muſt be an union with the Son, a cloſing with the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as with the promiſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now this is more than to offer Grace, yea, than to offer Heaven to poor ſinners. Therefore it is we read of the marriage of the Kings Son: and ſhall we deſpiſe ſuch a match as this? God forbid. 5. Surely this is a find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time in an eſpecial manner, he offers with entreaties, and invitations to accept. He doth not make an offer and away, as careleſs whether poor ſinners accept or no: but he follows his offers with arguments, if by any means he might prevail with poor Souls, before it be too late. 6. He offers all he hath. O will neither his perſon nor his benefits take with the Souls of poor ſinners? All he hath may be yours; If he have pardoning mercy, it is yours; if he have ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying mercy, it is yours; if he have comforting mercy, it is yours. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts you in all his fulneſs upon your cloſure with him: He beſtows upon you a large joynture upon your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52041:96"/>with him. All is yours. Then certainly this is an eſpecial finding time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond eſpecial finding time is, when the Spirit breaths upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their attendances upon God. We read of a certain ſeaſon in which the Angel came down and moved the waters. There are ſome certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that the Spirit of God doth breath more freely upon poor ſinners than at other times; and theſe times we are to make an eſpecial improvement of. The Spirit of God, it is ſaid, came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sampſon</hi> by times. Certain briezes, if you will give me leave to call them ſo, that come from Heaven at certain times. <hi>The wind blows where it liſteth.</hi> O but poor Souls, be ſure you loſe not theſe winds; when they ſtand fair for Heaven, do not let them ſlip; loſe not a gale for Eternity, for they are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial finding times. 1. Theſe gales once gone, and they are irrecoverable. There is no buying a wind for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if you would give all the world for it: one fair gale loſt, and thy poor Soul may lye wind-bound unto thy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52041:96"/>very dying day. 2. Theſe gales once gone, and your hearts harden. Sinners hearts harden, as the gales of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God are abuſed, and ſo ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And O what a ſad caſe will it be for a poor Sinner to lye upon a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed crying out, this heart of mine, as very a ſtone as it is, as hard, as it is now, once was breathed upon by the Spirit to cloſe with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but I ſinned all thoſe precious breathings from my Soul, and ſo by degrees hardned for Hell apace. 3. Theſe winds will not alwayes blow upon you, the wind will not alwayes ſtands here. Say ſo when under the Spirits breathings. The wind will not alwayes hold thus fair for Heaven; it will not alwayes blow in this quarter. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtrive with man.</hi> You muſt not think of having a trade-wind for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 4. Theſe gales muſt you give an account for. Why did not you move with ſuch a fair wind, when you had it? This queſtion one day will be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your precious Souls. O what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will you give in that day? Did not my Spirit ſtrive with you? but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52041:97"/>you reſiſted it, and vexed it, and quenched it. Every motion you ever had and ſlighted, will come in as an evidence againſt you another day. 5. Theſe gales once gone will fill your Souls with horrour that you have loſt them; that you were in ſo fair a way for cloſing with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet miſs of him; ſo nigh the Kingdom, and never come at it. O how it grieves a man to miſcarry, that had once a fair wind! O had I but taken the opportunity of a wind, how happy had I been! Who can think of it, but with dread, to look back upon all the motions that you have loſt, all the breathings you have loſt, and to ſay under the ſenſe of all theſe being loſt, Now your Souls are loſt too?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eſpecial finding time is in a time of univerſal calamities and judgments upon nations. When the deluge is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon the face of the earth, then he is willing to ask Souls to let them have room in himſelf.<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.6.</note> 
                  <hi>For this ſhall every one pray unto thee in a time when thou wilt be found</hi> (and obſerve what follows) <hi>Surcly in the floods of great
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52041:97"/>waters they ſhall not come nigh thee.</hi> Some Expoſitors take it of a finding God in a time of general trouble and calamity. Therefore we have that ſweet counſel, <hi>Seek ye the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeek meekneſs if that you may be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> When the Lords Judgements are abroad, he calls upon poor Sinners to ſue to him, after an eſpecial manner. O poor ſinners, <hi>How can your hearts endure, or your hands be made ſtrong in the day that I ſhall deal with you?</hi> (ſaith the Lord.) You will be like the man-ſlayer that had no City of Refuge to fly to, when the avenger of blood was upon him: And was not this a very ſad caſe? Well may it be ſaid to ſuch, <hi>What will you do in the day of your Viſitation? and where will you leave your Glory?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 10.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and whither will you flee for help?</hi> God would never have given that eſpecial counſel, when he was to march in his anger through <hi>Iſrael, therefore prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael,</hi> if he did not aime, it ſhould be an eſpecial time of finding him. O what a <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeeking, nay finding time was the plague, when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52041:98"/>death and danger faced you every day, nay every hour? when the Grave and Hell opened their mouths wide to ſwallow you?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another eſpecial time of finding, is, a time of perſonal affliction: when ſinners months are upon them, <hi>in their months one ſhall find her,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 2.24.</note> ſpoken of the wild Aſs. So it is with a poor Sinner. He cannot be tamed, cannot be brought to hand, brought to the hand of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but when affliction is upon the ſinner, O then it is an <hi>Ephraim; Thou chaſtiſedſt me and I was chaſtiſed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 37.18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke;</hi> but yet the Lord tamed the Bullock. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> as wild as he was, was thus tamed, and brought to ſeek the Lord, when he was in the bryars and fetters. Now is a time for the ſinner to return from iniquity:<note place="margin">Job 36.9.</note> (ſo <hi>Job</hi> hath it) <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another eſpecial time of finding <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is, when the Soul is under the ſenſe of its bewildred, loſt eſtate and condition; O then the Soul looks out after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſees it is undone without <hi>Christ,</hi> a periſhing loſt Soul for ever.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52041:98"/>This put the Prodigal upon returning to his Father, <hi>and I periſh by hunger.</hi> The Lord allures the Soul into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, it knows not what to make of its condition, it is in a wilderneſs of doubts and objections, but yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> now is found of it, and ſpeaks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably unto it. Now the Soul doth as the four Lepers in the gate of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> they were under the ſentence of death in their own apprehenſions, and therefore they conclude they could but dye: So they reſolve to go into the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Camp; rather than dye in the Gate they would dye in the Field. Thus ſayes a poor Soul, I can but dye, therefore I will go out to <hi>Christ,</hi> and if I dye I will dye at his foot, if I periſh I periſh. Now this is a time wherein the Lord is found of poor Souls.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another eſpecial time, is a time of violent and fierce aſſaults and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations from Satan. <hi>Paul</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this time to be an eſpecial praying time. <hi>Paul beſought the Lord thrice:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7, 8.</note> and it was an anſwering time, <hi>my Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Satan, he is the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52041:99"/>great Seeker after Souls, <hi>ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> O now the Soul runs from Satan to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to take ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in <hi>Christ.</hi> Some poor Souls have cauſe to bleſs God for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation-experiences, upon this very account that Satan's aſſaults have ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened them to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Thus God out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoots Satan in his own bow.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the Soul meets with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments from the Creature, this is another eſpecial finding time. The poor Church ſpeaks as a diſappointed people;<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Come let us return unto the Lord.</hi> We have been big-bellied with expectations and hopes from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but all proves but a tympany: come therefore ſay they, let us return unto the Lord; He will not diſappoint us. The Lord was reſolved to make up a hedge of diſappointments againſt the poor Church, and now ſhe reſolves what to do.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>I will return to my firſt Husband, it was better with me then than it is now.</hi> Diſappointments have been the occaſion of the converſion of many. The Prodigal would fain have filled his belly with the husks the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52041:99"/>Swine did eat; here was his deſire: no man gave him to eat; here was his diſappointment. And what then does he reſolve on? O then he reſolves to ariſe and go to his Father.</p>

               <p>Is it ſo, that there are ſome eſpecial times of finding <hi>Chriſt?</hi> then it is a word of counſel. O then let no ſuch times ſlip you! Lay hold of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock of your eſpecial times. There is time and opportunity, and we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt them: opportunity is time filled up with ſeaſons of Grace. O be ſure then poor Souls you redeem opportunities. It is the ſame counſel that the Apoſtle gives them,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Redeem the time;</hi> and the reaſon is very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>for the dayes are evil.</hi> A man hath a fair wind; he hath waited long for it; and now it is come about, he will not neglect it. O when the wind preſents, be ſure then you take it! O poor Soul, haſt thou not laid long without a wind for Heaven? Well, now it is come about. O then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52041:100"/>it. O poor Soul, put not off theſe precious gales; ſay not, come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to morrow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe eſpecial ſeaſons and times you muſt be accountable for. And can you anſwer it before the Great God, Sinners, that you did trifle with thoſe ſeaſons that did concern your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls? God puts every Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account, every Sabbath upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, every Motion, nay, every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon account; they are all bookt down in Gods book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and though you have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, yet he hath not. O what horrour will fill your Souls, and what confuſion of face will be upon you, when you ſhall be called to an account for all your eſpecial times of finding <hi>Chriſt?</hi> 2. Theſe eſpecial times of finding <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are not all perſons pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. He hath not dealt with all people as with you. How many parts of the world that never were enriched with the tenders of Goſpel-grace as you have been, but lie in the rubbiſh of ignorance and ungodlineſs? Nay, how many that have lived under the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52041:100"/>ſound of the Goſpel, and yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is hid to them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3.</note> and ſuch ſouls are loſt? And ſhall your Souls be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged above others in the being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe eſpecial ſeaſons, and you not improve them? 3. Theſe eſpecial times if you let ſlip, you will be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rivetted in your ſins. After men have ſinned away the day of Grace, O then they grow worſe and worſe. Then their poor Souls do ſwim down the ſtream of all manner of prophaneneſs. Have you not often obſerved it, that after ſinners have worn off their Convictions they have been more careleſs, more prophane, more reſolute in their courſe of ſin? 4. Theſe eſpecial times if you let them ſlip, it may be, you ſhall never have ſuch times again. <hi>My Spirit ſhall no more ſtrive with man.</hi> His bowels will be ſhut up in diſpleaſure againſt you. You may out-live the breathings of the Lord upon your Souls. And O if God ſhould awaken you, and cauſe you to reflect upon what hath paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and your Souls, O then it may be you will cry out, O that it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52041:101"/>were with me as in months paſt! O for one of the Motions of the Spirit of God I have ſleighted! O for one of the Convictions I have murdered! 5. Theſe eſpecial times will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aggravate your ſin, in ſtanding out againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A woe was written upon the head of <hi>Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida.</hi> O when <hi>Christ</hi> ſhall ſay, what have you to ſay for your ſelves? was not I tendred unto you? was not I offered with all the benefits of my death? but you would none of me. O now how will ſuch poor Souls run to the rocks, yea be fit to creep into the holes of the ragged rocks for the Majeſty of the Lord?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Word is a word of direction. What ſhall we do by way of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe eſpecial times, or how ſhall we improve them?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would you improve theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial finding times? Then 1. Lament ſenſibly over your loſt time. Lapſed time goes to the heart of a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinner: nothing doth cut ſo deep, as the conſideration of trifling away golden ſeaſons of Grace. It was
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52041:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>the charge the Lord brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jezabel, I gave her ſpace to repent, but ſhe repented not.</hi> O for a poor ſoul to reflect upon the time that is paſt, then it will cry as <hi>Job</hi> did in that caſe, <hi>O that it were with me as in months that are paſt!</hi> O that I might enjoy one of the dayes of the Son of Man, that I have ſo ſlighted! The Apoſtle tells us of ſome who for the time might have been Teachers of others, but alas they had loſt their time. If you loſe but a tide-time, you can fret at that, and be impatient: O how many tide-times have you loſt for Eternity? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appointment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in which the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> breaths, is a tide-time. O how many market-dayes for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have your Souls loſt? And can you remember them, and not lament over them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would you improve theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial finding times? Conſider then, you cannot miſ-improve, neglect theſe, but you put a ſleight upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O how dangerous is this to put a ſleight upon the Lord Jeſus, when he is willing to be found of you! What a ſleight was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52041:102"/>that they put upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when they made all their excuſes, they could not come! when <hi>Chriſt</hi> tenders himſelf and is refuſed. Therefore he complained, <hi>but my people would have none of me.</hi> For the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> to leave the boſome of his Father, the Glory of Heaven, and be clothed in, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to our nature, and be made a curſe for us, and after all this to be ſlighted by a company of poor ſinners; O what monſtrous ingratitude is this! Would we ſlight a Relation, a Friend, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance thus? Is not this to be highly uncivil to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> O how do poor ſinners put their incivilities upon <hi>Chriſt!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Would you not miſ-improve theſe eſpecial finding times? then conſider how this grieves <hi>Chriſt.</hi> When he came nigh the City, he wept over it; what was the matter? this was the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that did draw tears from <hi>Chriſts</hi> eyes, that they had enjoyed an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial time, and day of Grace in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was willing to have been found of them. <hi>O that thou hadſt known in this thy day, &amp;c.</hi> We read alſo of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52041:102"/>thoſe that refuſed the tenders of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the maſter of the houſe was angry at them. O take heed of angring <hi>Chriſt,</hi> poor ſinners, in this reſpect. <hi>Kiſs the Sun lest he be angry.</hi> What if he be,<note place="margin">Pſ. 2. ult.</note> and you <hi>periſh from the way? When his wrath is kindled but a little. Bleſſed are they that truſt in him.</hi> O who can ſtand before the wrath of the Lamb? Yea, what can cover us from the wrath of the Lamb? O what ingratitude is this, to grieve him for loving you, to requite him evil for good! Is this your kindneſs to your friend? Will you thus requite the Lord, O you fooliſh Souls? Do you thus anſwer his love in coming from heaven upon your errand? It is ſaid, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>Chriſt was grieved becauſe of their unbelief, and the hardneſs of their hearts.</hi> You would not willingly grieve a Relation, a Father, a Mother; and will you grieve <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Direction.</hi> Would you not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improve theſe eſpecial finding times? then live in the conſideration of what depends upon them. Upon theſe times depend your eternal conditions: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52041:103"/>on theſe monoſyllables depends eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; upon theſe <hi>Nows,</hi> theſe preſent gales, and ſeaſons of Grace. We ſay of ſome buſineſs, that we are very ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about, there is much depends upon it. It is a matter of grand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. This is the caſe; thy lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of theſe ſpecial times, is a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of great moment, as much as your immortal Souls are worth. O that every time you prayed, you might ſay, this is for eternity: and every time you heard a Sermon, O poor Soul, this is for eternity. As that great Painter ſaid, <hi>propter aeternitatem pingo:</hi> So ſhould every poor ſinner ſay of his duties. Write <hi>Eternity</hi> upon the head of them. I have read of one that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many years in a Cave under the earth among multitudes of Gnats, to the wonder of many; he was inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their diſturbances: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given is this, he was come thither to contemplate eternity. So do I ſay, the conſideration and contemplation of eternity would make you forget the world and the comforts of it, when you make your approaches to God.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:52041:103"/>5. Would you not miſ-improve theſe eſpecial finding times? O then live much in the conſideration of the worth of your Souls. You cannot ſlight the ſeaſons of Grace, but you ſlight your own Souls. O that that word were daily before you, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> It is one of the firſt conſiderations uſually that ſets a poor ſinner upon looking out after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> What will become of my Soul, if I dye in this condition? Am I not eternally undone? and then what am I better for all the traſh I have gathered together? What gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it the Hypocrite, when the Lord ſhall take away his Soul? 1. Conſider your Souls are Heaven-born Souls, from above, breathed in by God; and will you ſlight them? 2. A ſpiritual being. 3. An immortal being. 4. A being that cannot be ſatisfied with any ſublunary objects. 5. A Soul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Communion with God here. 6. Capable of the fruition of God hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> is a word of examination,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52041:104"/>or inquiry. Are there ſome eſpecial times and ſeaſons in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found? Then have ever your poor Souls found <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe times? Is not this an inquiry worth following? By being <hi>found of Christ,</hi> I mean as the word explains it, cloſed with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a poor Soul meets, a poor Soul takes <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and accepts of him upon the terms of the Goſpel, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes a poor Soul: for as there is a taking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo there is a receiving on <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſide.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If your Souls have found <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then you have ſeen your Souls in a loſt, and bewildred condition, <hi>this my Son was lost, and is found.</hi> He was bewildred in his far Country, but now his return was his finding time. <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſually meets with the Soul in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>I will allure her into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and ſpeak comfortably to her.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hof. 2.14.</note> O how is a poor Soul at its firſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt</hi> bewildred and loſt, cannot tell what to make of his condition, ſees nothing but miſery before it, ſees nothing but Hell gaping upon him,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52041:104"/>cryes out, it is undone, and without hope!</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you have found <hi>Christ,</hi> then you will ſell all, part with all for him.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.44.</note> You read of the Merchant man that when he had found the Pearl of price, he ſold all to purchaſe it. Some take it, he ſold all his ſins he ſo dearly lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, parted with them: Some take it, he parted with all his own Righteouſneſs, which we are naturally as loth to part with as our Sins. O thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> when he accounted <hi>all things dung and droſs in compariſon of the excellency of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> They that have found the Lord Jeſus, they do not ſtand with him. We read, this was that which cauſed the young man in the Goſpel to leave <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he could not part with all, <hi>he had great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</hi> Now you are like to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether you have found <hi>Chriſt</hi> or no. If you have found the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> you have not only been convinced of ſin, and ſo ſeen your loſt condition; but you have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Righteouſneſs. There are many poor Souls that ſtick at their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52041:105"/>convictions of ſin, and get no further, and prove like fooliſh children, that ſtay long in the place of breaking forth: but all this while throws and pangs are put upon the Soul to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the birth, yet the Soul hath not cloſed with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is but now like a man convinced of his diſeaſe, and ſees his miſery, but is at an utter loſs for a remedy. O but now the convictions of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Christ</hi> to pardon, and freely juſtifie the ſinner, this is the remedy. A ſight of ſin, without a ſight of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no converting work. You may be convinced of your ſins, and dye in them, and go to Hell in them. When the poor Prodigal was found, O then the beſt Robe <hi>(viz.) Chriſts</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was to be fetcht forth and put upon him. Now poor Soul, did thou ever take thy flight to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to be found in him? When the poor Infant we read of, was found out in its blood, what did God? ſayes the Text, <hi>he caſt his skirt over it, (viz.)</hi> the skirt of the robe of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:52041:105"/>4. If you have found <hi>Chriſt</hi> you will now know how you part with him. <hi>I found my Beloved</hi> (ſayes the Spouſe.) O but it was after long ſeeking! And now doth ſhe hold him with as ſlack a hand of faith as ſhe did? O no, <hi>I will hold him, and will not let him go.</hi> O now the Soul reſolves nothing ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate him from the love of God in <hi>Christ Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If you have found <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you will commend him unto others, and ſet him off to others, that they may ſeek him alſo. Thus did the Spouſe, <hi>This is my Beloved;</hi> and ſhe commends him in every part, from Top to Toe. And what is the fruit of this ſetting forth the excellency of <hi>Chriſt? We will ſeek him with thee.</hi> Lovers will be commending one another. O how doſt thou ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> doth thy Soul tell others what a Beloved thy Beloved is? what a bleſſed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thy <hi>Chriſt</hi> is? and ſay, this is my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and this is my Friend?</p>
               <p>We are now come to the third <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52041:106"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the eſpecial duty of poor ſinners to obſerve thoſe times in which Chriſt will be found:</hi> ſeek him while he may be found, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is but in time, (we ſay) and out of time. Mariners will obſerve their winds, and be ſure not to neglect them, be it night or day if they be preſent. Merchants will obſerve their Marts, and not neglect them, that they may buy the Commodities at the beſt hand. Nay, we read of other Creatures ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their times; to ſtir up poor, careleſs, ſtupid man. The Ant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves her time, and in Summer layes up for Winter; and the Prophet ſays, <hi>The Swallow and the Stork know their appointed times,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 8.7.</note> 
                  <hi>and obſerve the time of their coming.</hi> O how doth God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of man, that his miſery is great upon him, becauſe he knows, not his time?<note place="margin">Eccl. 8.6.</note> By <hi>obſerving of them,</hi> we are to underſtand laying hold of them, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe times by the fore-lock, and improving them to the utmoſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for the ſpiritual good of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls. We read therefore that excellent Counſel of the Apoſtles <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52041:106"/>the time:</hi> An alluſion to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that obſerve their Mart-times, who will be ſure not to neglect them. Every poor believer, and every poor ſinner ought to be obſervers of the times in this ſence. They ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when the Lord ſtrives and breaths with their poor Souls in his Ordinances. They ſhould obſerve how the Lord allures and draws their hearts after himſelf. Therefore it is we have ſuch eſpecial times pointed at by the finger of God, that poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might not miſs of them. God points at them in the word that they may be obſerved. Now acquaint thy ſelf with God. There is but a <hi>Now</hi> for it, a preſent time for it: this loſt,<note place="margin">Job 21.22.</note> and thy Soul is loſt for ever. You muſt not think to put it off and ſay <hi>to morrow:</hi> No, the Lord ſayes <hi>Now;</hi> and ſhould not you ſay, <hi>Lord, why not Now?</hi> O do not ſay, come again <hi>at a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time. Chriſts</hi> time is the moſt convenient time, and this is <hi>Chriſts</hi> time. <hi>Now is the accepted time, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> See how the finger of Free Grace points out the time. O poor Soul, now
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52041:107"/>thou mayſt be accepted of God, and laid in his boſome: Now his heart is open, now his arms are widened, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting thy running in thither; and if thou miſs of this accepted time, thou wilt for ever be rejected of God. <hi>Now or never</hi> is the language of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in an Ordinance.<note place="margin">Heb. 3.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Hearken to his voice while it is to day.</hi> See ſtill how God points at the preſent time. <hi>While it is to day.</hi> It may be you may be dead to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; why may not I ſay, damned to morrow? Who knows what to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may bring forth?<note place="margin">Luk. 12.36.</note> We read of opening to <hi>Chriſt</hi> immediately. O poor ſinners, you ſhould not delay the buſineſs, but ſtrike in with <hi>Chriſt</hi> while he is beſeeching of you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Poor Sinners ſhould be obſervers of <hi>Chriſts</hi> times. This the Lord calls to; and if we do not this, we turn a deaf ear to this bleſſed charmer. O what a pity it is, that a poor Soul ſhould be deaf to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> As though <hi>Christ</hi> only preached hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Fathers diſpleaſure. And alas, poor ſinners, it is the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; he preaches Heaven to you,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52041:107"/>Salvation to you. <hi>This day,</hi> ſaith he, poor Sinner, <hi>ſalvation is come unto thy houſe.</hi> If you will not come to him, he will come to you with his Salvation. This makes me remember that ſweet call of <hi>Chriſts</hi> in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 46. ult?</note> 
                  <hi>Hearken unto me ye ſtout-hearted that are far from Righteouſneſs.</hi> O poor Gentile Sinners, that are afar off from me, nay, that do oppoſe me: yet ſayes he, <hi>I bring near my Righteouſneſs.</hi> One would have thought it would have been, You ſtout-hearted I bring near my wrath, I bring near my judgements: O no but Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts. He calls ſuch to accept of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and his Salvation, and ſhall we be deaf to ſuch calls? What a call is that, Hearken to his voice <hi>while it is to day? Chriſt</hi> calls to poor Sinners, that they would lay hold of their eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is complained on by God. The Calls of God, and the complaints of God do both ſpeak it. And O this hath been complained on of old. O what a complaint was that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt <hi>Jeruſalem, O that thou hadſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52041:108"/>known in this thy day, &amp;c!</hi> And this complaint came from <hi>Chriſt</hi> weeping. He came nigh the City; and wept over it. Surely it is ſome notable Sermon <hi>Chriſt</hi> preaches, now he weeps: O this was it, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did not know her day.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.37.</note> And at another time, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee as a Hen gathers her Chickens under her wings, but ſhe would not</hi> be gathered. I would have gathered them into me, gathered them out of their ſins, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them out of the world; my armes were ſtretched out to that very end, but they obſerved not their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering times. Alas, what are the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Grace but <hi>Chriſts</hi> gathering times? He ſees, poor Souls are like a Lamb in a large place, and they will wander and wander untill they drop into the Pit, whence there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, if <hi>Chriſts</hi> compaſſions do not gather them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to obſerve our eſpecial times in which <hi>Christ</hi> will be found, elſe we receive the Grace of God in vain.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> writing upon this ſubject, <hi>We beſeech you</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>as workers
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52041:108"/>with him that you receive not the Grace of God in vain;</hi> and then follows, <hi>I have heard thee in an accepted time, &amp;c.</hi> He had been in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaking of the Miniſtry of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, now ſayes, <hi>We beſeech you that you receive not this Grace,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of the Miniſtry of Reconciliation) <hi>in vain;</hi> which you will do, if you obſerve not that <hi>now is the accepted time, that now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> The end of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is fruſtrated if you obſerve not theſe times in which he is willing to be found, for he offers himſelf in order to acceptation. O how ſad would this be for ſo many Sermons of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of his Love, of the Riches of Grace, to be in vain! For <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſay, I have laboured in vain, <hi>I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought,</hi> and in vain.<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.4.</note> It is ſpoken in the perſon of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Is it not a pity free Grace ſhould ſpend its breath in vain? O what will ſinners have to ſay or anſwer the Lord, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſay to them, O how many Sermons of my own Love, of my Fathers Love, did I preach to you, but who hath believed my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52041:109"/>All theſe were in vain. I could not be credited by you, though I came from the boſome of the Father to preach all theſe things unto you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sinners are to obſerve thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial times in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be found, becauſe upon theſe eſpecial times depends Eternity. The eternal condition of a poor Soul depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of theſe <hi>Nows.</hi> That very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit of God, which it may be thou ſlighteſt, or that very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it may be thou refuſeſt to hear, or upon the very conviction thou ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereſt with thy worldly enjoyments or employments, it may be upon theſe very times did depend your eternal conditions. That Sermon thou was not at, might have been the means of thy Converſion. As I cloſe with theſe Calls of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> fall in with theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> ſo it will be with my Soul to all Eternity. O did but ſinners think of this one thing, this one Truth, how ſerious would it make them in their obſervation of ſuch times? Now this is for eternity, this motion, this ſtriving of the Spirit
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52041:109"/>of God with my poor Soul. If any of you were going to Sea on a voyage, and all that you were worth depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that voyage, and if you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried you were undone, wives and children undone, O how careful would you be to obſerve your time, your winds, your markets? This is the caſe; thou art engaged in a voyage that all thou art worth is concerned in, nay infinitely more than thou art worth, even thy precious Soul; and if thou miſcarry in this voyage thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, even undone to all Eternity. O then what a mad man art thou that obſerveſt not what may tend to the ſecurity of thy great venture <hi>(viz.)</hi> thy precious Soul? Obſerve then thy gales for this voyage; it is either a making or a marring voyage.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Sinners are to obſerve <hi>Chriſts</hi> times, when he is willing to be found, becauſe theſe times loſt will aggravate the condemnation of poor Souls. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not tendred himſelf ſo to all as he hath done to you. O how many Souls have lived and died without the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> How many that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52041:110"/>heard of a <hi>Chriſt?</hi> as they ſaid, <hi>We have not ſo much as heard of an Holy Ghoſt.</hi> How many that ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſhadow of death? How many parts of the world that are the <hi>dark places of the earth, full of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Cruelty?</hi> You do not hear ſuch Sermons in <hi>India</hi> as you do in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> you do not hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tendred at <hi>Guiny,</hi> at <hi>Jamaica.</hi> Suppoſe thoſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that you converſe with there, ſhould know what you have heard of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, and what you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed of <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſeeing no more of Chriſtianity, no more of likeneſs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> among you, certainly they would ſay, this <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an Impoſtor, and this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity a cheat, a deluſion to gull the world withal. Therefore upon this account it is that a woe was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida; If I had never ſpoken unto you,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>you had not had ſin.</hi> O Sirs, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never been preached to you, never been tendred to you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſeeched you, never wooed you,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52041:110"/>you had been under leſs guilt: but now your ſin remains; and how can you eſcape, who have neglected ſo great ſalvation? You may think to eſcape, you may think you have ſome back door to creep out at; but alas, how can you eſcape (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to the Phariſees) the damnation of Hell?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe times of <hi>Chriſts</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be found will not laſt alwayes. O what ſtronger reaſon to obſerve them! <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man.</hi> You think, poor Sinners, that I will alwayes wait on you, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wooe you, alwayes beſeech you: O no poor Sinners, times are coming on that my Bowels will be ſhut up in diſpleaſure againſt you, my Bridge of Mercy ſhall be drawn, and my Gate of Mercy ſhall be ſhut, and then what will you do? O poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, what ſtanding will there be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in that day? what crying, <hi>Lord, Lord open unto us?</hi> Do you think to have a trade-wind to heaven? do you think the wind will alwayes blow fair in your voyage for Eternity? The time is coming that the Lord Jeſus (as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52041:111"/>it is ſaid of thoſe Angels) will keep the winds in his hands,<note place="margin">Rev. 7.1.</note> and not ſuffer them to blow on a poor Soul. That was good Counſel of our dear Lord, <hi>work while it is day, the night comes wherein no man can work.</hi> Your day will not alwayes continue, the night comes. May it not be ſaid by many poor Sinners, <hi>Woe unto us, our day go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away?</hi> And alas poor Sinners, the night is no time for working in.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> There are no <hi>Chriſt</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times beyond this life. No <hi>Chriſt</hi>-finding times in the Grave, whither we are all going. That is excellent counſel,<note place="margin">Pecl. 9.10</note> 
                  <hi>what thou findest to do, do it with all thy might.</hi> Now is the doing time, this preſent time is only the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time: and the reaſon is very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>for there is no work in the Grave whither we go:</hi> then it is paſt time to work for Heaven, to work for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O that word is a ſad word, <hi>it is past time.</hi> As the Tree falls ſo it lies to all Eternity; there is no turning of it on the other ſide. O then poor Souls had need look to it, and make ſure when they fall, they fall

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52041:112"/>us of the great ſtupidity and ſenſeleſneſs that is upon the Souls of poor Sinners naturally. They go on in the neglects of <hi>Chriſt</hi> untill the Lord Jeſus meet them, and ſtop them. They do not conſider. Nay, it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Lord againſt his own people, that they were worſe than brutes,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Oxe knows his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib; and yet my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not know, they do not conſider.</hi> O the bruitiſhneſs of our hearts!

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It informs us that it is not the having times of <hi>Chriſts</hi> offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but it is the obſerving of theſe times, that we are eſpecially to look after. It is indeed a great Mercy to have them, but it is a greater to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them. We may ſay in this caſe as in that, <hi>who is wiſe, will obſerve theſe things, and the prudent ſhall know them.</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:52041:112"/>There are many poor Souls who are now in Hell, that have lived under the Calls of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under the offers of <hi>Christ.</hi> What ſay you to <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida?</hi> You may hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> forty years together preached; nay, you may profeſs <hi>Chriſt;</hi> nay, you may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Chriſt</hi> for loaves many years, and after all this be Caſt-awayes; nay, a man may preach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and at laſt be a Caſt away.</p>

Is the ſalvation of an immortal Soul a jeſting matter? are Heaven and <hi>Chriſt</hi> indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences?

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Are not ſuch poor Souls to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved? This is the higheſt ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and unthankfulneſs in the world; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould make offers, and be willing to be found, and you put a ſlight upon him, and you not obſerve them.

               <p n="2">2. Are not ſuch Souls to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? This ſpeaks great infidelity and unbelief. Is not this the reaſon why <hi>Christ</hi> and poor ſinners make not a cloſure, they do not believe he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive them, to embrace them, to pardon them. This croſs-iron bolt and bar of unbelief lies betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a poor Soul, and was it not this that grieved <hi>Chriſt?

O poor ſinners, after all <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed, all he hath ſuffered, all he hath done, that you ſhould ſlight <hi>Christ,</hi> when he is willing to be found of you, is not this ſad?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Are not ſuch to be reproved? You will obſerve times for your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecular advantages; you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Summer ſeaſon to go into the Countrey for the air, if your bodies need it; you will obſerve times to take phyſick in; you will obſerve your winds to ſail in; you will obſerve your marts and fairs; you will obſerve your
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52041:115"/>Change-time, and all this for your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage: and alas, you neglect your eſpecial times and ſeaſons for your Souls. All theſe things are but your outward concernments, but there are things that concern the peace of your immortal Souls, and how do you look after them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo that the Lords find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times ought to be obſerved by poor Sinners? Then it is a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to poor Sinners, that they would take eſpecial notice of ſuch times; that it may not be ſaid of you, as is ſaid in that caſe <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The Lord paſſed by on my left hand, and on my right hand, and I perceived him not.</hi> For God to be near a poor Soul in an Ordinance, in a motion of the Spirit, and the Soul ſee him not, for the eyes of the Soul to be held that it knows him not, O how ſad is this! O delay not to lay hold of <hi>Christ</hi> at ſuch times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your delayes will provoke and diſpleaſe <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> loves that Souls ſhould cloſe with him without delays. We read of ſome that delayed the matter, and fell to framing excuſes,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52041:115"/>and the Lord was angry with them, and ſaid, <hi>They ſhould not taſte of his Supper.</hi> The Spouſes delay to open to <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo diſpleaſed him, that he did withdraw from her, and ſhe paid dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for her delay. Now did he ſtand waiting, untill his <hi>locks were filled with the drops of the night?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Your delays are diſhonourable to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They diſhonour him, as though he were not to be truſted, when he calls for Souls to cloſe with him, to open to him immediately, as though there were no great danger, as though it were but a dallying, jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, and you could do it when you would, even at your leiſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your delayes will prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to your own Souls. We ſay there is danger in delay; and O how true is that in Soul caſes! What if God ſhut up his bowels in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? What if he will be gracious no more in viſiting you, in breathing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, in knocking at your doors? What if the Lord do withdraw from you, and ſay he will wait no more upon you, ſtrive no more with you,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52041:116"/>but paſs that Sentence upon you, <hi>Let them alone, let them wander like a Lamb in a large place.</hi> O poor Sinners, you are in danger of all this, and much more by your delayes to obſerve <hi>Chriſts</hi> times of being willing to be found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your delayes will make your falling in with <hi>Chriſts</hi> finding times, a great deal more difficult. Yea every day it will be more difficult than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sin and corruption will grow ſtronger, Satans temptations will be more violent. The longer a Soul is held in a ſnare, the faſter it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will be more difficult, you will have fewer motions of the Spirit to call you out, and thruſt you out to cloſe with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Delay to anſwer the Spirits breathings, doth put him upon withdrawing. When poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have ſo often quenched the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Spirit lets them alone, and ſtrikes ſparks of holy motions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions there no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be more difficult, your ſelves will have leſs heart to it. The longer a poor Soul lies ſnoring in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52041:116"/>bed of ſin, the leſs mind he hath to get up. And indeed ſuch ſouls ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome get up, untill the cry of fire, fire (I mean hell fire) get into their Conſciences. The longer a man ſits upon a ſeat, the ſtiffer he is, and the unfitter he is to ſtir and riſe; ſo it will be in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will be the more difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe guilt is every day more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. The more guilt, the leſs mind to cloſe with thoſe times in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be found. It is with a Soul in this caſe, as it was with our firſt Parents; they were afraid, when they ſaw they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and they hid themſelves. Guilt is for running away from God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will be more difficult, Satan will be ſtronger with his oppoſition. His temptations and objections will get faſter hold of you. If you had ſought <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſooner, if you had early in the morning looked after him, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he might have been found of you: but now ſayes Satan, it is too late; your day of Grace is paſt; now his bowels are ſhut up in diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52041:117"/>you. Such objections will make dreadful work with poor guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Souls. O it muſt needs be ſad when Satans objections get into our Conſciences.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It will be the more difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſenſe of former delayes will fill the heart for the preſent with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and miſgivings of God and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Alas, I have ſtayed too long, I doubt it is now paſt time; will he be found of me, at this time of the day? will he receive me that come ſo late? will he not tell me there is no room for one that hath dallied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed ſo long? O ſuch jealouſies will exceedingly hinder the Souls falling in with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Your delayes, to obſerve <hi>Chriſts</hi> times in which he is willing to be found, may in time bring a hardneſs of heart upon you; and O how ſad would this be? Take heed your hearts be not hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. You think you can cloſe with <hi>Chriſt</hi> another time as well as this, in another Ordinance as well as this, in another duty as well
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52041:117"/>as this; and alas, in a little time you come to be hardned by your delayes.</p>
               <p>We are come now to the fourth and laſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> in the Text.</p>
               <q>There is a day and time in which Chriſt will not be found, as well as a day and time in which Chriſt will be found.</q>
               <p>Though <hi>Christ</hi> offer himſelf to poor Sinners now, yet he will not alwayes do ſo; his Golden Scepter of Free Grace will not alwayes be held out: As there is a time to hold it out, ſo there is a time to take it in. Though he call long, wait long, knock long, yet he will not alwayes ſtand at your doors.<note place="margin">Luk. 12.36</note> Therefore we read of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him immediately.

               <p>But the great inquiry will be this; What are theſe times in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be found?

               <p n="1">1. When Souls are ſhut up, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up under obduracy and judicial hardneſs of heart. Give me leave to diſtinguiſh betwixt a natural obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of heart, and a judicial obduracy of heart; betwixt being under hardneſs of heart, and being ſhut up under it.

The kidneys were offer'd in ſacrifice to the Lord, to teach us he regards the inwards, the integrity of our hearts in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52041:119"/>our ſacrifices. <hi>Chriſt</hi> loves to be ſought to in good earneſt with all your hearts. The divided heart was found faulty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When poor Souls ſeek him ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. We are to ſeek him diligently. We read, to teach us this leſſon, that the Aſs, the firſtling of an Aſs was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God in ſacrifice, and Snails, thoſe ſlow-paced creatures were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean creatures. We ſhould not be ſlothful in ſeeking <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Will he be found of the ſluggard? When the Spouſe ſought <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Bed, he would not be found of her. The Spouſe at another time indulged her ſelf in her ſloth, and then <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not be found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another time in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be found, is, when you have griev'd and quenched the motions of his ſpirit: now he will withdraw from you and will not be found; then he ſayes, his <hi>ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When do poor Sinners grieve the Spirit that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be found? 1. When they refuſe him, though he hath ſtood long knocking at their doors and waited upon them. Thus we ſee he did by the Spouſe, he waited
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52041:119"/>long, untill his locks were ſilled with the dew of the night, and yet ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and you ſee how ill <hi>Chriſt</hi> took this, and did withdraw upon it. O poor Soul, how long haſt thou made <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſtand and wait? But know he will not always thus wait.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When we believe not his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive us, then we grieve him and cauſe him to withdraw. <hi>He was grieved becauſe of their unbelief, and the hardneſs of their hearts,</hi> ſaith the Text.

                  <hi>how long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all my ſigns and wonders?</hi> Unbelief puts God to his <hi>How-longs:</hi> Therefore the Prophet complains, perſonating <hi>Chriſt, who hath believed our report, &amp;c.</hi> Muſt it not needs grieve him when you do not believe him? 1. He promiſes to you mercy and pardon, poor ſinners, upon your coming over to cloſe with him; and would it not grieve any, to have the moſt ſerious and ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſlighted? To be look'd upon as a perſon unfaithful, this takes Gods good name from him; his name is <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52041:120"/>Is not he faithful who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?</hi> 2. He is ſent from his Father to declare, this is the heart of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo; and this muſt needs grieve him that you ſhould not credit his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that he ſhould come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth with ſuch an errand, and cannot be truſted. If you ask, but how comes he to be ſo well acquainted with his Fathers heart?<note place="margin">1 Joh. 18.</note> He tells us, he lay in his Fathers boſome, therefore he can tell beſt how it beats toward poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 3. He hath ſealed with an oath; <hi>As I live ſayes the Lord, I delight not in the death of a ſinner.</hi> O ſurely the Lord would gladly have poor ſinners to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his love. As one ſayes, O happy man, for whoſe ſake the Lord ſwears; O unhappy man that will not truſt a ſwearing God! The oath of God is for confirmation of Gods good will to poor Souls. O how muſt it then grieve him that he cannot have his oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? 4. O how it grieves him now he hath ſealed this love with his blood! Herein Divine Love is commended to poor ſinners, that while Enemies <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for them. 5. It muſt needs
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52041:120"/>grieve him, not to believe him after ſo long waiting upon them. Now when we have thus griev'd him, he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, &amp; not be found of poor finners.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Time in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be found of poor Souls, is, when in a time of mercy &amp; proſperity we have ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and yet in a time of judgment and calamity ſeek him, but only ſeek him by being affrighted at his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Iſrael</hi> forgat God in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and how did God take it? and he ſaid, <hi>I will hide my face from them,</hi>

Be not deceived poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Christ</hi> will not alwayes wait upon you, not always be willing to be found of you. The time is coming that his bowels will be ſhut up in diſpleaſure, that he will be gracious no more, that his mercies will be clean gone for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. O then why do you trifle now? will the gates of mercy alwayes ſtand open? will <hi>Chriſts</hi> arms always be held wide open? 1. Here is great folly in trifling in ſeeking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is a matter of eternal conſequence. There is no trifling in great caſes. We ſay we muſt be ſerious, it is a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. O! Soul-concernments are great concernments. If I miſcarry (ſays a man) in this deſign, I am undone. O
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52041:121"/>then he will be mighty watchful and careful: So ſayes a poor Soul, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in this great buſineſs, if I miſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I am undone, yea to all eternity undone. 2. O the great folly of trifling in ſeeking <hi>Chriſt!</hi> This is all the time you have to ſeek him in. When a man hath a work allotted to him, and he muſt do it in ſuch a time, elſe it can never be done, O what folly it is to trifle that time away allotted for that work! and this is the caſe; this preſent life-time is your allotted time to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to get acquaintance with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and after the hour-glaſs of this preſent time be out, you will never have more time for this work. <hi>There is no work in the grave whither you go.</hi> I often tell you the grave is too dark a ſhop to do any Soul-work in. 3. O the folly of trifling in ſeeking of <hi>Chriſt!</hi> ere long it will be paſt time. Is not this great folly, to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle when time goes ſo faſt away? If you were like to have a long day, you might ſay ſomething, ſinners, for your trifling: but to have a ſhort day, and a great deal of work, and to triflle any of it away, this muſt needs be great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

               <p n="3">3. It informs of the wiſdome of ſuch poor Souls as ſeek him in a day and time when he will be found; wiſdom obſerves to take its fitteſt times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. There is much in timing actions. O now this Soul and heavenly wiſdom is all for obſerving its ſeaſons. Here the fooliſh Virgins miſs'd it ſadly; they did not obſerve their ſeaſons for getting oyl into their lamps. 1. Is not this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſeek the Lord while he may be found? this will lay you in againſt the moſt tremendous and terrible diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations that can come upon earth. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appears much in foreſight, and in laying ſomething in for a rainy day. O poor ſouls, you know not what rainy days hang over your heads; what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible clouds cover the face of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and what ſhakings of earth and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52041:122"/>heaven may come. Therefore it is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> before ſuch dayes come, that the Lord may not be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to us in an evil day. Therefore it is that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is propheſied of to be a covert from rain and from ſtorm, and a refuge. He is the only City of refuge to fly to, when purſuers are abroad. 2. Is it not wiſdom to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> while he may be found? this will fit you for death. Is it not great wiſdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our latter end? This is that which God wiſhed his own people might do. Was not it wiſdom in the five wiſe Virgins, that they prepared for the Bridegrooms approaching? O how much wiſdom appears in this! It is the property of a fool to ſay, <hi>non pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>târam,</hi> I had not thought. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then have died fools, ſaying, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought an intereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo difficult a thing to obtain; I never thought of any times in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not be found. 3. Is it not great wiſdom to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> while he may be found? your eternal happineſs depends upon it. Is it not wiſdom to provide for eternity? every man thinks it wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52041:123"/>to provide for his own family; what then is it to provide for his own Soul? 4. Is it not wiſdom to do that now, which elſe your Souls will repent to all eternity? Wiſdom conſiſts in preventing after-repentings. O how many Souls are repenting the loſs of their time in hell! and ſaying, O if they were to live on earth again, and had their opportunities to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> again, they would never be ſuch loyterers and ſluggards in the matters of their Souls. 5. Is it not wiſdom to do that which you came into the world to do? Was not this to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, to look about for your ſalvation? Did you come into the world to eat and drink and riſe up to play? What, needed you immortal ſouls for ſuch ſenſual employments? 6. Is it not wiſdom to do that God gives you time on purpoſe it might be done? Why doth God exerciſe ſo much patience? Why doth he hover over Souls, and continues thus to be gracious, but that he would ſtill have them ſeek the Lord Jeſus. 7. Is it not <hi>wiſdom</hi> to do that now, which we have only means now to do
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52041:123"/>it in? No means of ſeeking <hi>Chriſt</hi> after this life; no means then of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God. Now our dayes are filled up with means and Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to this end.</p>

O then while he is to be found ſeek him. 2. You muſt be judged according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opportunities you have now for your Souls. <hi>The word,</hi> ſayes <hi>Chriſt, that I ſpeak, ſhall judge you at the laſt day.</hi> 3. Seek him in your preſent day, it will lie heavy upon you that you loſt ſo much time in which you might have

Seek him in your preſent day, if others had enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Golden Scepter-ſeaſons, they would have kiſſed the Scepter, and have ſubmitted to the terms of the Lord Jeſus, they would have believed, they would have repented, yea, in ſack-cloth and aſhes, as is ſaid of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> 5. Seek him in your preſent day, the damned Souls that have loſt him for ever, if God ſhould priviledge them to have another day of Grace to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> in, O how would they ſeek him! how would they mourn for him! Would they hear as you do? pray as you do? ſweal a way their time upon which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity doth depend as you do? Would they miſ-improve precious ſeaſons for their ſouls as you do? If you did but know what the loſs of an immortal Soul meant, is it poſſible you could ſleep away, play away <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Salvation?</hi> 6. Seek him in your preſent day, your Enemies ſeek you becauſe you ſeek him. To be ſought after by Enemies and found by them, as you muſt reckon of one time or other; and yet not to find <hi>Chriſt,</hi> O how ſad is this! Methinks our enemies ſhould ſtir us up to lay hold of all ſeaſons to ſeek <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Could you young ones, or old ones, go to priſon and have not yet found him whom

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it ſo, that there are times in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not be found? It is then a word of terrour to all ſuch as live in their neglects to ſeek the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What, poor Souls, if his bowels ſhall ceaſe yearning towards your Souls? What if they ſhould be ſhut up in diſpleaſure? If the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſtrive with you no more, O what a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condition were your Souls in then!</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your danger that live in neglects of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is much in this, your offers and tenders of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will never be forgotten by you in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world. O they will ſtick by your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in hell! Nothing will aggravate poor ſinners condemnation ſo, as this, they ſlighted the offers of life and ſalvation by <hi>Chriſt. How can you eſcape, if you neglect ſuch great ſalvation? It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>than for</hi> Chorazin <hi>and</hi> Bethſaida. Why ſo? the one had <hi>Chriſt</hi> preached and offered to them, and ſo had not the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no poſſibility for your eſcape that neglect to ſeek <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whoever eſcape you cannot. <hi>How can you eſcape, &amp;c.</hi> O poor Souls, can you contend with the wrath of an Omnipotent God? <hi>Can your hearts endure, or your hands be made ſtrong in that day he ſhall deal with you?</hi> If you cannot eſcape it, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with it, O how miſerable are you!
